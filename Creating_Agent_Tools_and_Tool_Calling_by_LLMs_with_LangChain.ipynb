            "Summary: Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational corporation and technology conglomerate headquartered in Redmond, Washington. Founded in 1975, the company became influential in the rise of personal computers through software like Windows, and the company has since expanded to Internet services, cloud computing, video gaming and other fields. Microsoft is the largest software maker, one of the most valuable public U.S. companies, and one of the most valuable brands globally.\n",
            "Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. During the 41 years from 1980 to 2021 Microsoft released 9 versions of MS-DOS with a median frequency of 2 years, and 13 versions of Windows with a median frequency of 3 years. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market. Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000.  He oversaw the then-largest of Microsoft's corporate acquisitions in Skype Technologies in 2011, and an increased focus on hardware that led to its first in-house PC line, the Surface, in 2012, and the formation of Microsoft Mobile through Nokia. Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has changed focus towards cloud computing, as well as its large acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in 2016. Under Nadella's direction, the company has also expanded its video gaming business to support the Xbox brand, establishing the Microsoft Gaming division in 2022 and acquiring Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in 2023.\n",
            "Microsoft has been market-dominant in the IBM PC–compatible operating system market and the office software suite market since the 1990s. Its best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems and the Microsoft Office and Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, which most notably include the Word word processor, Excel spreadsheet editor, and the PowerPoint presentation program. Its flagship hardware products are the Surface lineup of personal computers and Xbox video game consoles, the latter of which includes the Xbox network; the company also provides a range of consumer Internet services such as Bing web search, the MSN web portal, the Outlook.com (Hotmail) email service and the Microsoft Store. In the enterprise and development fields, Microsoft most notably provides the Azure cloud computing platform, Microsoft SQL Server database software, and Visual Studio.\n",
            "Microsoft is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Meta. In April 2019, Microsoft reached a trillion-dollar market cap, becoming the third public U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion. It has been criticized for its monopolistic practices, and the company's software has been criticized for problems with ease of use, robustness, and security.\n",

            "Summary: Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS and iPadOS. It features calculation or computation capabilities, graphing tools, pivot tables, and a macro programming language called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Excel forms part of the Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Office suites of software and has been developed since 1985.\n",
            "\n",
            "Page: Microsoft Office\n",
            "Summary: Microsoft Office, MS Office, or simply Office, is an office suite and family of client software, server software, and services developed by Microsoft. The first version of the Office suite, announced by Bill Gates on August 1, 1988, at COMDEX, contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint — all three of which remain core products in Office — and over time Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, Object Linking and Embedding data integration and Visual Basic for Applications scripting language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the Office Business Applications brand.\n",
            "The suite currently includes a word processor (Word), a spreadsheet program (Excel), a presentation program (PowerPoint), a notetaking program (OneNote), an email client (Outlook) and a file-hosting service client (OneDrive). The Windows version includes a database management system (Access). Office is produced in several versions targeted towards different end-users and computing environments. The original, and most widely used version, is the desktop version, available for PCs running the Windows and macOS operating systems, and sold at retail or under volume licensing. Microsoft also maintains mobile apps for Android and iOS, as well as Office on the web, a version of the software that runs within a web browser, which are offered freely.\n",
            "Since Office 2013, Microsoft has promoted Office 365 as the primary means of obtaining Microsoft Office: it allows the use of the software and other services on a subscription business model, and users receive feature updates to the software for the lifetime of the subscription, including new features and cloud computing integration that are not necessarily included in the \"on-premises\" releases of Office sold under conventional license terms. In 2017, revenue from Office 365 overtook conventional license sales. Microsoft also rebranded most of their standard Office 365 editions as \"Microsoft 365\" to reflect their inclusion of features and services beyond the core Microsoft Office suite. Although Microsoft announced that it was to phase out the Microsoft Office brand in favor of Microsoft 365 by 2023, with the name continuing only for legacy product offerings, later that year it reversed this decision and announced Office 2024, which they released in September 2024.\n"

AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta, aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.\n",

Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture. In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom. Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms, while raising ethical concerns about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\n",

Headquartered in [Redmond](/place/Redmond-Washington), Washington, Microsoft initially gained dominance in the [operating systems](/technology/operating-system) market during the 1980s and ’90s with MS-DOS and [Windows](/technology/Microsoft-Windows).

Other products in this category include HoloLens and other PC accessories.\\n\\n## Founding and early growth\\n\\nIn 1975 [Bill Gates](/money/Bill-Gates) and [Paul G. Allen](/money/Paul-Allen), two boyhood friends from [Seattle](/place/Seattle-Washington), converted [BASIC](/technology/BASIC), a popular mainframe [computer programming language](/technology/computer-programming-language), for use on an early [personal computer](/technology/personal-computer) (PC), the Altair. Shortly afterward, Gates and Allen founded Microsoft, deriving the name from the words *microcomputer* and *software*. During the next few years, they refined BASIC and developed other [programming languages](/technology/computer-programming-language).\\n\\n![IBM Personal Computer](https://cdn.britannica.com/08/23608-004-47D6DC21/IBM-Personal-Computer-machine-Microsoft-MS-DOS-operating-1981.jpg?w=385)\\n\\n**The world runs on DOS.** In 1980, [International Business Machines Corporation](/money/International-Business-Machines-Corporation) (IBM) asked Microsoft to produce the essential [software](/technology/software), or [operating system](/technology/operating-system), for its first [personal computer](/technology/personal-computer), the IBM PC. Microsoft purchased an operating system from another company, modified it, and renamed it [MS-DOS](/technology/MS-DOS) (Microsoft Disk Operating System). MS-DOS was released with the IBM PC in 1981. Thereafter, most manufacturers of personal computers licensed MS-DOS as their operating system, generating vast revenues for Microsoft; by the early 1990s, it had sold more than 100 million copies of the program and defeated rival operating systems such as CP/M, which it displaced in the early 1980s, and later [IBM OS/2](/technology/IBM-OS-2).\\n\\n**The Windows revolution.** Microsoft deepened its position in operating systems with [Windows](/technology/Microsoft-Windows), a [graphical user interface](/technology/graphical-user-interface) whose third version, released in 1990, gained a wide following. By 1993, Windows 3.0 and its subsequent versions were selling at a rate of one million copies per month, and nearly 90 percent of the world’s PCs ran on a Microsoft operating system. In 1995 the company released Windows 95, which for the first time fully integrated MS-DOS with Windows and effectively matched in ease of use [Apple Computer](/money/Apple-Inc)’s [Mac OS](/technology/macOS).\\n\\n**Powering the office.** Microsoft also became the leader in productivity software such as [word processing](/technology/word-processing) and [spreadsheet](/technology/spreadsheet) programs, outdistancing longtime rivals Lotus and WordPerfect in the process.\\n\\n**Entering the media world.** Microsoft dramatically expanded its electronic publishing division, created in 1985 and already notable for the success of its multimedia encyclopedia, *[Encarta](/topic/Encarta)*. It also entered the information services and entertainment industries with a wide range of products and services, most notably the Microsoft Network and [MSNBC](/money/MSNBC) (a [joint venture](/money/joint-venture) with the [National Broadcasting Company](/money/National-Broadcasting-Co-Inc), a major American television network, which began in 1995 and ended in 2012).\\n\\n## The price of success: Regulatory scrutiny\\n\\nBy the mid-1990s Microsoft, which [became a publicly owned corporation](/money/ipo-initial-public-offering) in 1986, had become one of the most powerful [brands](/money/brand) and [profitable](/money/earnings-per-share-quarterly-earnings) companies in American history. It consistently earned profits of 25 cents on every sales dollar, an astonishing record. In the company’s 1996 [fiscal year](/money/fiscal-year), it topped $2 billion in [net income](/money/profit) for the first time, and its unbroken string of profits continued, even during the [Great Recession](/money/great-recession) of 2007–09 (its net income had grown to more than $14 billion by fiscal year 2009).\\n\\nIts rapid growth in a fiercely competitive and fast-changing industry, however, spawned resentment and jealousy among rivals, some of whom complained that the company’s practices violated U.S. laws against unfair competition. Microsoft and its defenders countered that, far from stifling competition and technical innovation, its rise had encouraged both and that its software had consistently become less expensive and more useful. A [U.S. Justice Department](/topic/US-Department-of-Justice) investigation concluded in 1994 with a settlement in which Microsoft changed some sales practices that the government contended enabled the company to unfairly discourage Windows customers from trying alternative programs. The following year the Justice Department successfully challenged Microsoft’s proposed purchase of [Intuit Inc.](/money/Intuit-Inc), then the leading maker of financial software for PCs.\\n\\n## Chasing the Internet and a return of regulatory woes\\n\\nPartly because of its stunning success in PC software, Microsoft was slow to realize the commercial possibilities of network systems and the [Internet](/technology/Internet). In 1993 it released Windows NT, a landmark program that tied disparate PCs together and offered improved reliability and network security. Sales were initially disappointing, but by 1996 Windows NT was being hailed as the likely standard for PC networking, quickly surpassing Novell’s NetWare in market share.\\n\\nMicrosoft did not move into Internet software until a new venture, [Netscape Communications Corp.](/money/Netscape-Communications-Corp), had introduced Navigator, a Web [browser](/technology/browser) that simplified the once-arcane process of navigating the [World Wide Web](/topic/World-Wide-Web). In a violent change of course, Microsoft quickly developed its own browser, [Internet Explorer](/technology/Internet-Explorer), made it free, and moved aggressively to persuade computer makers and Internet service providers to distribute it exclusively. By 1996 Microsoft was bundling Explorer with Windows OS and had begun the process of integrating Explorer directly into Windows. In response, Netscape accused Microsoft of violating its 1995 consent decree and sued; those efforts helped to persuade the Justice Department to reopen a broad investigation of Microsoft.\\n\\nIn 1999, following a trial that lasted 30 months, a judge found Microsoft in violation of the [Sherman Antitrust Act](/event/Sherman-Antitrust-Act) (1890) and ordered the breakup of the company. In 2001 an appeals court overturned the breakup order but still found the company guilty of illegally trying to maintain a [monopoly](/money/monopoly-economics). The company’s legal woes continued in 2004: The [European Union](/topic/European-Union) (EU) levied the largest fine in the organization’s history to that point, €497.2 million ($611 million), in retaliation for what were described as Microsoft’s near-monopoly practices. In February 2008 the EU imposed an even higher fine, €899 million ($1.35 billion), on the company for having defied the EU’s 2004 antitrust decision against Microsoft for illegally bundling multimedia software with its Windows operating system to the exclusion of competitors.\\n\\n## Entry into the gaming and mobile phone markets\\n\\nIn 2001 Microsoft released the [Xbox](/technology/Xbox), an [electronic game](/topic/electronic-game) console that quickly captured second place in the video gaming market. In 2002 it launched [Xbox Live](/topic/Xbox-Live), a broadband gaming network for its consoles. A more powerful gaming console, the [Xbox 360](/technology/Xbox-360), was released in 2005. In an intensely competitive market, where the Xbox faced strong pressure from the [Nintendo Wii](/topic/Nintendo-Wii) and [Sony](/money/Sony) [PlayStation](/topic/PlayStation), Microsoft struggled through the years to make consistent profits from its console. For example, in 2009 the company cut the price of the Xbox 360 Elite by as much as 25 percent in order to pick up market share. The move was successful; by 2010 the Xbox 360 was the most-used game console in the American home. But at the same time, the price cuts also led to a 6 percent drop in revenue in Microsoft’s Entertainment and Devices Division (EDD). The Xbox 360 was succeeded in 2013 by the Xbox One, which in turn was replaced by Xbox Series [X](/money/Twitter) and Xbox Series S in 2020.\\n\\n![Xbox 360 at the Tokyo Game Show](https://cdn.britannica.com/59/90459-050-2293BA10/Microsoft-video-game-machine-demonstration-units-Xbox-2005.jpg?w=385)\\n\\nOther EDD products also struggled. The Zune family of portable media players introduced in 2006 failed to challenge the market dominance of Apple’s [iPod](/technology/iPod), and it was discontinued in 2011. The Windows Mobile OS, used in [smartphones](/technology/smartphone) made by a variety of vendors, including HTC, LG, [Motorola](/money/Motorola-Inc), and [Samsung](/money/Samsung-Electronics), trailed in market share in the [United States](/place/United-States) behind Research in Motion’s [BlackBerry](/technology/BlackBerry-wireless-device) and Apple’s [iPhone](/technology/iPhone). In 2009 Microsoft ceased publishing online and disc versions of its *[Encarta](/topic/Encarta)* encyclopedia.\\n\\n![Britannica Money Logo](https://cdn.britannica.com/money/assets/Money-475x60-footer-2x.png?h=47&w=390)'},\n",

Microsoft was founded on April 4, 1975, by [Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates \"Bill Gates\") and [Paul Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen \"Paul Allen\") in [Albuquerque, New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico \"Albuquerque, New Mexico\").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-founding-1) Its current best-selling products are the [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows \"Microsoft Windows\")[operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system \"Operating system\"); [Microsoft Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office \"Microsoft Office\"), a suite of productivity software; [Xbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox \"Xbox\"), a line of entertainment of games, music, and video; [Bing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_(search_engine) \"Bing (search engine)\"), a line of search engines; and [Microsoft Azure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure \"Microsoft Azure\"), a cloud services platform.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-MSFT-20190130-2)\\n\\nIn 1980, Microsoft formed a partnership with [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM \"IBM\") to bundle Microsoft\\'s operating system with IBM computers; with that deal, IBM paid Microsoft a royalty for every sale. In 1985, IBM requested Microsoft to develop a new operating system for their computers called [OS/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2 \"OS/2\"). Microsoft produced that operating system, but also continued to sell their own alternative, which proved to be in direct competition with OS/2. Microsoft Windows eventually overshadowed OS/2 in terms of sales. When Microsoft launched several versions of Microsoft Windows in the 1990s, they had captured over 90% market share of the world\\'s personal computers.\\n\\nAs of June 30, 2015, Microsoft has a global annual revenue of US$86.83 billion (~$109 billion in 2023) and 128,076 employees worldwide.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-2014Revenue-3) It develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software \"Computer software\") products for computing devices.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-2005annual-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-fastfacts-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-2007financials-6)\\n\\n1975–1985: The founding of Microsoft\\n------------------------------------\\n\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Microsoft&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: 1975–1985: The founding of Microsoft\")]\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Altair_8800_and_Model_33_ASR_Teletype.jpg/250px-Altair_8800_and_Model_33_ASR_Teletype.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Altair_8800_and_Model_33_ASR_Teletype.jpg)\\n\\n[Altair 8800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800 \"Altair 8800\") computer with the popular Model 33 ASR Teletype as terminal, paper tape reader, and paper tape punch.\\n\\nIn late 1974, [Paul Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen \"Paul Allen\"), a programmer at [Honeywell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeywell \"Honeywell\"), was walking through [Harvard Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Square \"Harvard Square\") when he saw the cover of the January 1975 issue of _[Popular Electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular\\\\_Electronics \"Popular Electronics\")_ that demonstrated the [Altair 8800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800 \"Altair 8800\"), the first [microcomputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcomputer \"Microcomputer\").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-keyevents-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-leibovich20001231-8) Allen bought the magazine and rushed to [Currier House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currier_House_(Harvard_College) \"Currier House (Harvard College)\") at [Harvard College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College \"Harvard College\"), where he showed it to high school friend [Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates \"Bill Gates\").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-leibovich20001231-8) They saw potential to develop an implementation of [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC \"BASIC\") for the system.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-9)\\n\\nGates called Altair manufacturer [Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Instrumentation_and_Telemetry_Systems \"Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems\") (MITS), offering to demonstrate the implementation. Allen and Gates had neither an interpreter nor an Altair system, yet in the eight weeks before the demo, they developed an interpreter with the help of [Monte Davidoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Davidoff \"Monte Davidoff\"). When Allen flew to [Albuquerque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico \"Albuquerque, New Mexico\") to meet with MITS, the interpreter worked and MITS agreed to distribute [Altair BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_BASIC \"Altair BASIC\").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-thocp1-10)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-leibovich20001231-8) Allen moved to Albuquerque, Gates soon quit Harvard to join him, and they co-founded Microsoft there.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-leibovich20001231-8) Revenues of the company totalled $16,005 by the end of 1976.\\n\\n[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5e/Microsoft-Staff-1978.jpg/250px-Microsoft-Staff-1978.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Microsoft-Staff-1978.jpg)\\n\\nMicrosoft staff in Albuquerque, December 7, 1978\\n\\nTop: [Steve Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Steve_Wood_(entrepreneur)&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Steve Wood (entrepreneur) (page does not exist)\"), [Bob Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Wallace_(computer_scientist) \"Bob Wallace (computer scientist)\"), [Jim Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jim_Lane_(Microsoft)&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Jim Lane (Microsoft) (page does not exist)\")\\n\\nMiddle: [Bob O\\'Rear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_O%27Rear \"Bob O\\'Rear\"), [Bob Greenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bob_Greenberg_(programmer)&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Bob Greenberg (programmer) (page does not exist)\"), [Marc McDonald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_McDonald \"Marc McDonald\"), [Gordon Letwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Letwin \"Gordon Letwin\")\\n\\nBottom: [Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates \"Bill Gates\"), Andrea Lewis, [Marla Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marla_Wood&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Marla Wood (page does not exist)\"), [Paul Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen \"Paul Allen\")\\n\\nNot pictured: [Ric Weiland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Weiland \"Ric Weiland\"), [Miriam Lubow](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Miriam_Lubow&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Miriam Lubow (page does not exist)\")[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-Allen2011-11)\\n\\nAllen came up with the original name of _Micro-Soft_, a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau \"Portmanteau\") of [microcomputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcomputer \"Microcomputer\") and [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software \"Software\").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-12) Hyphenated in its early incarnations, on November 26, 1976, the company was registered under that name with the Secretary of State of New Mexico. The first employee Gates and Allen hired was their high school collaborator [Ric Weiland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Weiland \"Ric Weiland\").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-thocp1-10) The company\\'s first international office was founded on November 1, 1978, in Japan, entitled \"[ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_(company) \"ASCII (company)\") Microsoft\" (now called \"[Microsoft Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Japan \"Microsoft Japan\")\"), and on November 29, 1979, the term, \"Microsoft\" was first used by Bill Gates.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-keyevents-7) On January 1, 1979, the company moved from Albuquerque to a new home in [Bellevue, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue,_Washington \"Bellevue, Washington\"),[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-keyevents-7) since it was hard to recruit top programmers to Albuquerque.

The company restructured on June 25, 1981, to become an incorporated business in its home state of Washington (with a further change of its name to \"Microsoft Corporation, Inc.\"). As part of the restructuring, Bill Gates became president of the company and chairman of the board, and Paul Allen became executive vice president and vice chairman.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-keyevents-7) In 1983, Allen left the company after receiving a [Hodgkin lymphoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin_lymphoma \"Hodgkin lymphoma\") diagnosis, though he remained on the board as vice-chairman. This effectively ended the formal business partnership between Gates and Allen, which had been strained months prior due to a contentious dispute over Microsoft equity.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-before_microsoft-14) Later in the decade, Gates and Allen repaired their relationship and together the two donated millions to their childhood school [Lakeside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakeside_School_(Seattle) \"Lakeside School (Seattle)\").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-leibovich20001231-8) They remained friends until Allen\\'s death in October 2018.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-Gates_Mourns_Allen-15)\\n\\nMicrosoft\\'s early products were different variants of [Microsoft BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_BASIC \"Microsoft BASIC\") which was the dominant programming language in late 1970s and early 1980s home computers such as [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II \"Apple II\") ([Applesoft BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applesoft_BASIC \"Applesoft BASIC\")) and [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64 \"Commodore 64\") ([Commodore BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_BASIC \"Commodore BASIC\")), and were also provided with early versions of the [IBM PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC \"IBM PC\") as the [IBM Cassette BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Cassette_BASIC \"IBM Cassette BASIC\").\\n\\nMicrosoft also marketed through an Apple dealer in West Palm Beach, Florida two products for the Radio-Shack TRS-80. One was \"Typing Tutor\" which led the user through learning to use a keyboard. The other was authored by a professor at the University of Hawaii called \"MuMATH\" and had the ability to do mathematics in long integer math to avoid floating point numbers.\\n\\n[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Microsoft_Softcard_Z80_coprocessor_for_Apple_II.jpg/250px-Microsoft_Softcard_Z80_coprocessor_for_Apple_II.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Microsoft_Softcard_Z80_coprocessor_for_Apple_II.jpg)\\n\\nThe [Z-80 SoftCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-80_SoftCard \"Z-80 SoftCard\"), released in 1980\\n\\nThe first hardware product[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-lock19800506-16) was the [Z-80 SoftCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-80_SoftCard \"Z-80 SoftCard\") which enabled the Apple II to run the [CP/M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M \"CP/M\")[operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system \"Operating system\"), at the time an industry-standard operating system for running business software and many [compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler \"Compiler\") and [interpreters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing) \"Interpreter (computing)\") for several [high-level languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_language \"High-level language\") on [microcomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcomputer \"Microcomputer\"). The SoftCard was first demonstrated publicly at the [West Coast Computer Faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Computer_Faire \"West Coast Computer Faire\") in March 1980.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-Infoworld_Apr_1980-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-Infoworld_Nov_1980-18) It was an immediate success; 5,000 cards, a large number given the microcomputer market at the time, were purchased in the initial three months at $349 (~$1,084 in 2023) each and it was Microsoft\\'s number one revenue source in 1980.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-19)\\n\\nThe first operating system publicly released by the company was a variant of [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix \"Unix\") announced on August 25, 1980. Acquired from [AT&T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T \"AT&T\") through a distribution license, Microsoft dubbed it [Xenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenix \"Xenix\"), and hired [Santa Cruz Operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz_Operation \"Santa Cruz Operation\") in order to port/adapt the operating system to several platforms.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-xenix1-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-21) This Unix variant would become home to the first version of Microsoft\\'s [word processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor \"Word processor\"), [Microsoft Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_Word \"Microsoft Office Word\"). Originally titled \"Multi-Tool Word\", Microsoft Word became notable for its use of \"What You See Is What You Get\", or [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG \"WYSIWYG\") pioneered by the [Xerox Alto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto \"Xerox Alto\") and the [Bravo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravo_(software) \"Bravo (software)\") text editor in the 1970s.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-22)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-23)\\n\\nSkeptics questioned the system software vendor\\'s decision to produce application software. Gates said that doing so was not what _InfoWorld_ phrased as a \"big-time operation\", but Microsoft spent aggressively, with a reportedly \"unlimited\" R&D budget despite others in the industry advising against overexpansion.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-caruso19840402-24) Word was first released in the spring of 1983, and free demonstration copies of the application were bundled with the November 1983 issue of [PC World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_World \"PC World\"), making it one of the first programs to be distributed on-disk with a magazine.

It grew to become the most popular version of Unix, measured by the number of machines running it[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-27) (note that Unix is a multi-user operating system, allowing simultaneous access to a machine by several users). By the mid-1980s Microsoft had gotten out of the Unix business, except for its ownership stake in [SCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenServer \"OpenServer\").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-xenix1-20)\\n\\n[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/PC_DOS_1.10_screenshot.png/250px-PC_DOS_1.10_screenshot.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PC_DOS_1.10_screenshot.png)\\n\\nA typical [PC DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_DOS \"IBM PC DOS\")[command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface \"Command-line interface\")\\n\\n[IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM \"IBM\") first approached Gates and Allen about Microsoft\\'s upcoming [IBM Personal Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer \"IBM Personal Computer\") (IBM PC) in July 1980, shortly after Gates\\'s mother began working on [United Way\\'s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Way \"United Way\") executive board with IBM CEO [John Opel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Opel \"John Opel\").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-RoyAllen-26)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-bunnell1982febmar-28) On August 12, 1981, after negotiations with [Digital Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Research \"Digital Research\") failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft to provide a version of the [CP/M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M \"CP/M\") operating system, which was set to be used in the IBM PC. For this deal, Microsoft purchased a [CP/M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M \"CP/M\") clone called [86-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/86-DOS \"86-DOS\") from [Tim Paterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Paterson \"Tim Paterson\") of [Seattle Computer Products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Computer_Products \"Seattle Computer Products\") for less than US$100,000, which IBM renamed to [IBM PC DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_DOS \"IBM PC DOS\"). The original CP/M was made by [Gary Kildall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Kildall \"Gary Kildall\") of [Digital Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Research \"Digital Research\"), Inc. Due to potential [copyright infringement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement \"Copyright infringement\") problems with CP/M, IBM marketed both CP/M and PC DOS for US$240 and US$40, respectively, with PC DOS eventually becoming the standard because of its lower price.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-29)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-30) Thirty-five of the company\\'s 100 employees worked on the IBM project for more than a year. When the IBM PC debuted, Microsoft was the only company that offered operating system, programming language, and application software for the new computer.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-bunnell1982febmar-28)\\n\\n_InfoWorld_ stated in 1984 that Microsoft, with $55 million (~$137 million in 2023) in 1983 sales,[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-caruso19840402-24)\\n\\n> is widely recognized as the most influential company in the microcomputer-software industry.

These documents, colloquially referred to as \"[The Halloween Documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents \"Halloween documents\")\", were widely reported by the media and went into detail of the threats that [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software \"Free software\") / [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software \"Open source software\") poses to Microsoft\\'s own software, previously voiced mainly by analysts and advocates of open source software.

Microsoft launched their second console, the [Xbox 360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360 \"Xbox 360\"), in 2005– which was more successful than the original. By 2017, the Xbox 360 had sold 84 million units[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-71) but failed to outsell its main rival, the [PlayStation 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3 \"PlayStation 3\"), which sold 87 million units when discontinued.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-WorldPS3Sales-72) The console was also outsold by the [Wii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii \"Wii\"), which introduced [gesture control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_user_interface \"Natural user interface\") and opened up a new market for video games. Microsoft later used their popular controller-free [Kinect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect \"Kinect\") peripheral to increase the popularity of the Xbox. This was very successful.

It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS \"MS-DOS\") in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. During the 41 years from 1980 to 2021 Microsoft released 9 versions of [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS \"MS-DOS\") with a median frequency of 2 years, and 13 versions of Windows with a median frequency of 3 years.

In 2015, he praised Microsoft for appointing two women to its board of directors.[[339]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-345)\\n\\nIn 2020, [Salesforce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce \"Salesforce\"), the manufacturer of the [Slack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_(software) \"Slack (software)\") platform, complained to European regulators about Microsoft due to the integration of the Teams service into Office 365. Negotiations with the European Commission continued until the summer of 2023, but, as it became known to the media, they reached an impasse. Microsoft is now facing an antitrust investigation.[[340]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-346)\\n\\nIn June 2024, Microsoft Corp. faced a potential EU fine after regulators accused it of abusing market power by bundling its Teams video-conferencing app with its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software. The European Commission issued a statement of objections, alleging Microsoft\\'s practice since 2019 gave Teams an unfair market advantage and limited interoperability with competing software. Despite Microsoft\\'s efforts to avoid deeper scrutiny, including unbundling Teams, regulators remained unconvinced. This action followed a 2019 complaint from Slack, which was later acquired by Salesforce. Microsoft\\'s Teams usage soared during the pandemic, growing from 2 million daily users in 2017 to 300 million in 2023. The company has a history of antitrust battles in the U.S. and Europe, with over €2 billion in EU fines previously imposed for similar abuses.[[341]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-347)\\n\\nIn October 2024, Microsoft fired two employees, software engineers Ibtihal Aboussad and Vaniya Agrawal,[[342]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-348) who organized an unauthorized vigil at its Redmond headquarters to honor Palestinians killed in the [Gaza war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_war \"Gaza war\"). The employees, part of the group \"No Azure for Apartheid,\" sought to address the company\\'s involvement in the Israeli government\\'s use of its technology.[[343]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-349) On 20 March 2025, before an event at Seattle\\'s Great Hall with Brad Smith and Steve Ballmer, protestors projected \"Microsoft powers [genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_genocide \"Gaza genocide\")\" on the wall. Subsequently, two employees interrupted AI executive Mustafa Suleyman at a speaking event on 4 April 2025 in protest at the company\\'s support of Israel.[[344]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-350) The [Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott,_Divestment_and_Sanctions \"Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions\") movement added Microsoft to its list of targets for partnering \"with the apartheid regime of Israel and its prison system\".[[345]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-351)In February 2025, the Associated Press reported that the Israeli military was utilizing Microsoft-developed artificial intelligence tools in its military and intelligence operations against the people of Gaza. In May 2025, Microsoft issued an unsigned statement confirming that these services had been made available to Israel. However, no evidence has yet been found to indicate that these tools were employed during the massacre of the people of Gaza.[[346]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-352)\\n\\nIn November 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched an investigation into Microsoft, focusing on potential antitrust violations related to its cloud computing, AI, and cybersecurity businesses. The probe scrutinized Microsoft\\'s bundling of cloud services with products like Office and security tools, as well as its growing AI presence through its partnership with OpenAI. This inquiry is part of broader efforts by the U.S. government to curb the power of major tech companies, especially under FTC chair Lina Khan. Concerns were raised about Microsoft\\'s licensing practices potentially locking customers into its services and its AI investments possibly sidestepping regulatory oversight.[[347]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-353)\\n\\nIn June 2025 Microsoft recently helped suspend the email account of an International Criminal Court prosecutor in the Netherlands who was investigating Israel for war crimes in order to comply with a Trump executive order.[[348]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-354)[[349]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-355)\\n\\nSee also\\n--------\\n\\n*   [List of mergers and acquisitions by Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Microsoft \"List of mergers and acquisitions by Microsoft\")\\n*   [Microsoft engineering groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_engineering_groups \"Microsoft engineering groups\")\\n*   [Microsoft Enterprise Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Enterprise_Agreement \"Microsoft Enterprise Agreement\")\\n\\nNotes\\n-----\\n\\n1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_ref-3)**After Apple and Amazon, respectively\\n2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_ref-11)**Parent company of Google\\n3.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_ref-12)**Parent company of Facebook\\n4.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_ref-200)**After Apple and Amazon, respectively\\n5.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_ref-247)**\\n\\n    *   [Game Workers Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Workers_Alliance \"Game Workers Alliance\") ([Raven Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven_Software \"Raven Software\"))\\n    *   Game Workers Alliance Albany\\n    *   Activision Quality Assurance United-CWA\\n    *   ZeniMax Workers United/CWA\\n    *   OneBGS ([Bethesda Game Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Game_Studios \"Bethesda Game Studios\"))\\n    *   World of Warcraft\\n    *   Texas Blizzard QA United-CWA\\n\\nReferences\\n----------\\n\\n1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_ref-1)**[\"Microsoft Corporation Form 10-K\"](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000789019/000095017024087843/msft-20240630.htm).

Bigelow,](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Stephen-J-Bigelow)Senior Technology Editor\\n\\n Published: Feb 24, 2025\\n\\nMicrosoft is the world\\'s largest vendor of computer software and a leading provider of cloud computing services, video games, computer and gaming hardware, search and other online services. Based in Redmond, Wash., Microsoft has offices across the U.S. and multiple countries worldwide.\\n\\nMicrosoft origins: 1975 to 1981\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nBill Gates, who it is believed wrote his first software program at age 13, joined forces with his childhood friend Paul Allen to start Microsoft (originally known as Micro-Soft for _microprocessors_ and _software_) in April 1975. At the time, Gates left Harvard University, and Allen left his job as a programmer in Boston. They sought to develop a compiler for the Altair 8800, a primitive early personal computer. Gates contacted the manufacturer, Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), and offered to write a program for a new computer.\\n\\nGates and Allen created an interpreter for BASIC, then a [mainframe programming](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/Write-side-up-by-Freeform-Dynamics/Mainframe-Skills-Challenge-or-Opportunity) language, to use with the Altair. MITS hired Gates and Allen in 1975. Within a year, they left to focus on their fledgling company, Microsoft, which they incorporated in 1981.\\n\\nMicrosoft history: 1980 to 2025\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nIn 1980, IBM engaged Microsoft to develop an [OS](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/operating-system-OS) for IBM\\'s PC. Called PC-DOS by IBM, Microsoft also marketed its own version, [MS-DOS](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterprisedesktop/definition/MS-DOS) (Microsoft Disk Operating System), which debuted in 1981 and which IBM licensed for its PC. The late 1970s and early 1980s saw Microsoft\\'s fortunes soar, with the company adding more companies to its client roster and licensing MS-DOS to many of them.\\n\\nThe initial versions of MS-DOS lacked a [GUI,](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/video/An-explanation-of-CLI-GUI-and-NUI) so users had to type in various commands to open any program. However, Microsoft later developed Interface Manager, a GUI that ran on top of DOS and became [Windows](https://www.techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/definition/Windows) in 1985. Windows, which included numerous graphical features such as drop-down menus and scroll bars, was inspired by the same Xerox PARC research project that [Apple](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Apple) used to move an arrow across a graphical desktop.\\n\\nIn 1986, Microsoft moved its headquarters to Redmond and went public, offering $21 per share in its IPO. The IPO made Gates a multimillionaire. In less than a decade, he became a multibillionaire and one of the world\\'s richest people.\\n\\nSince the late 1990s, Microsoft has been embroiled in numerous legal cases. In 1998, the U.S. Department of Justice filed antitrust charges against the company, accusing it of using its dominant market position to drive its competitors -- such as [Netscape](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Netscape) -- out of business. Microsoft lost the case, appealed, and lost again. Gates and other Microsoft leaders were forced eventually to modify certain corporate practices to reduce Microsoft\\'s unfair market monopoly. Due to its near-monopoly practices, Microsoft continued throughout the 2000s to face [legal challenges](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366593634/Microsoft-and-CISPEs-settlement-in-long-running-cloud-antitrust-dispute-proves-controversial) and had to pay hefty fines. Despite these challenges, Microsoft remains a healthy technology company with a strong market presence. As of January 2025, it is one of a handful of companies worldwide with trillion-dollar-plus market capitalizations.\\n\\nOver the past two decades, Microsoft has acquired numerous companies, many of them well-known, including [GitHub](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/GitHub), LinkedIn, Activision Blizzard and Skype. Since February 2014, CEO [Satya Nadella](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366545132/Microsofts-Nadella-sees-massive-growth-opportunity-in-AI) has led Microsoft.\\n\\nMicrosoft products\\n------------------\\n\\nBy the late 1980s, Microsoft had become the world\\'s largest PC software company. In the 1990s and 2000s, it continued to grow, developing and releasing new, innovative PC products, such as its Windows OSes, Office software suite and [Internet Explorer](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterprisedesktop/definition/Internet-Explorer) web browser.\\n\\nOver time, the company has forayed into the development of desktops and laptops, Xbox gaming consoles, security products such as antivirus software, security operations platform, endpoint detection and response software, and identity solutions. More recently, Microsoft has started expanding its global presence with cloud-based and [AI-enabled products](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366614628/AI-becomes-Microsofts-fastest-growing-business) like Azure Cloud, the Microsoft 365 software productivity suite, and the [Copilot](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Microsoft-Copilot) AI-powered chatbot.\\n\\n![Image 1: Chart showing how Copilot handles user prompts within Microsoft 365.](https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/how_copilot_processes_user_prompts-f_desktop_mobile.png)\\n\\nA look at how Copilot supports user prompts from Office apps. \\n\\n### Windows OS\\n\\nFor the first few years after releasing the Windows OS, Microsoft struggled to make the product a success.\\n\\nIt introduced Windows 1.0 in 1983, but the actual release didn\\'t happen until November 1985. Heavily influenced by Apple\\'s existing GUI, Windows 1.0 was more user-friendly than the command-line interface of MS-DOS, with menus a user could access with a keyboard or mouse. However, the presence of Apple\\'s GUI made it hard for Windows to gain traction.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t until the release of Windows 3.0 in 1990 that the OS gained some respect from the PC user base. The release of Windows 3.1 in 1992 finally led to Microsoft OSes earning widespread acceptance. In 1995, the release of Windows 95 -- an OS that integrated MS-DOS with Windows and was as easy to use as Apple\\'s Mac OS -- saw the beginning of a shift from DOS-based applications to Windows-based applications. This fueled the exponential growth and popularity of Windows as the preferred OS for PCs worldwide. By the 1990s, Windows had outsold most of its rival OSes, including CP/M and IBM OS/2.\\n\\nBut to run Windows, the PCs first had to load DOS. DOS was a 16-bit OS, while Windows was a 32-bit OS. The result was a crash-prone Windows. In 1992, Microsoft hired veteran developer David Cutler from Digital Equipment Corp. with the intention of building a new 32-bit OS from the ground up. It was called [Windows NT](https://www.techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/definition/Windows-NT) -- the NT standing for \"new technology.\" The first version, Windows NT 3.1, an upgrade over Windows 3.1, was released in 1992.\\n\\nWhile NT resolved the compatibility issues, its initial versions created other problems. System requirements were so great that few PCs could use it, so Microsoft shifted Windows NT to be a server OS. However, as hardware improved, more people began using Windows NT as a desktop OS.\\n\\nIn the late 1990s, Microsoft began merging Windows 95 and Windows NT into one OS. The result was Windows 2000 -- released in the year 2000 -- followed by Windows XP the following year for desktops, and Windows Server 2003 two years later. Even before the release of Windows 2000, previous versions of Windows were running 90% of the world\\'s PCs. Following Windows 2000, Microsoft released Windows XP in 2001, Windows Vista in 2007 and [Windows 10](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterprisedesktop/definition/Windows-10) in 2015. The most recent version of Windows, [Windows 11](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Windows-11-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know), came out in 2021.\\n\\nOther Windows releases include the following:\\n\\n*   Windows 98 in 1998.\\n*   Windows ME in 2000.\\n*   [Windows 7](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterprisedesktop/definition/Windows-7) in October 2009.\\n*   Windows 8 in October 2012 and Windows 8.1 in 2013.\\n\\n![Image 2: Microsoft Windows timeline infographic.](https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/microsoft_windows_timeline_the_38_year_evolution-f_mobile.png)\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows Timeline. \\n\\n### Windows Server\\n\\nMicrosoft NT 3.1 Advanced Server, released in 1993, set the foundation for Microsoft\\'s line of server and business desktop OSes. This OS, which could run on Intel x86 and other CPUs, was designed to handle critical business applications. Although it was replaced by Windows NT 3.5 in 1994, its basic OS kernel is still used for the 32-bit version of Windows 7 and in the NTFS file system.\\n\\nAfter 1994, Microsoft developed and released other versions of its server OS, including the following:\\n\\n*   Windows NT 3.5.1 in 1995.\\n*   Windows NT 4.0 in 1996.\\n*   Windows NT 5.0 in 1999.\\n\\nThese subsequent versions improved usability and stability and introduced the idea of the domain-based networking model for centralized network administration and unified user and access control.\\n\\nIn 2000, Microsoft released Windows 2000 Server, which further simplified network management with the then-new [Active Directory](https://www.techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/definition/Active-Directory) user directory feature. This OS also provided enhancements for storage management, web integration and application development. After Windows 2000 Server, Microsoft released nine more server OSes by 2022.\\n\\nWindows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 introduced Microsoft\\'s [Hyper-V](https://www.techtarget.com/searchvirtualdesktop/tip/Understand-the-limitations-of-running-Hyper-V-in-Windows-11), a hardware virtualization product that lets enterprise users create virtual machines ([VMs](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/virtual-machine-VM)) on physical computers. Subsequent versions of Windows Server improved virtualization. Additionally, these versions introduced cloud capabilities, such as Docker-compatible [containers](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/tip/Containers-vs-VMs-What-are-the-key-differences) that enabled companies to take better advantage of technological innovations like hybrid cloud environments, microservices and cloud-native applications.\\n\\n![Image 3: Chart comparing the structure of virtual machines and containers.](https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineImages/windows_server-virtual_machines_vs_containers_mobile.png)\\n\\nMore recent versions of Windows Server have improved virtualization capabilities, such as virtual machines and containers, which are contrasted here. \\n\\nWindows Server 2022 included advanced multilayer security features and a flexible application development platform. The latest iteration, [Windows Server 2025](https://www.techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/feature/Will-Windows-Server-2025-release-spark-VMware-migrations), was released in November 2024. It is available in three editions -- Standard, Datacenter and Datacenter Azure Edition. It is the first and only Windows Server OS that supports ARM64 architecture -- the 86-bit version of the ARM64 instruction set.\\n\\nKey features of all Windows Server OSes include Active Directory, which automates the management of user data, security and distributed resources, and enables interoperation with other directories; and Server Manager, a utility to administer server roles and make configuration changes on local or remote machines.\\n\\nAlso, from the 2016 version onward, Windows Server is available using two release channels: the Long-Term Servicing Channel ([LTSC](https://www.techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/definition/Microsoft-Windows-Server-LTSC-Long-Term-Servicing-Channel)) and the Annual Channel (AC). Organizations can choose their preferred channel, depending on whether they want a traditional lifecycle of quality and security updates (LTSC) or more frequent releases (AC).\\n\\n### Microsoft Office and Microsoft 365\\n\\nBuilding on the success of its OSes, Microsoft moved into the development of productivity software, which it dubbed \"Office.\"\\n\\n[Microsoft Office](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterprisedesktop/news/252522244/Microsoft-will-sign-idle-users-out-of-Office-web-apps) first appeared in 1990. The productivity package featured several bundled applications, including Word, Excel and PowerPoint for the desktop. More than two decades later, those applications remain popular with individuals and companies worldwide. Over the years, Microsoft added new products to the Office suite, including [Outlook](https://www.techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/definition/Microsoft-Outlook) (an email client), Access (a database management system), OneNote (a note-taking app), [SharePoint](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcontentmanagement/feature/Benefits-of-Microsoft-SharePoint) (a set of content management, knowledge management and website creation tools) and [Teams](https://www.techtarget.com/searchunifiedcommunications/definition/Microsoft-Teams) (a team collaboration application).\\n\\nMicrosoft\\'s pivot toward cloud computing is reflected in the development and release of [Microsoft 365](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterprisedesktop/definition/Microsoft-Office-365-suite), a cloud-powered productivity platform. First released in 2017 as Office 365 and renamed in 2020, Microsoft 365 is a browser-based yearly subscription version of Office that includes all the products available in the desktop versions of Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Teams, etc.). It also includes access to OneDrive, Microsoft\\'s cloud storage service (similar to [Google Drive](https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/definition/Google-Drive)) that lets users store data in the cloud and sync files with multiple devices.\\n\\nUnlike Microsoft 365, the latest desktop-based version of Office, Office 2024, is sold as a one-time purchase. It does not have all of the same features that are available by default in the cloud- and subscription-based Microsoft 365.\\n\\nRecently, Microsoft has strengthened Microsoft 365 with AI-powered features using Copilot, a [generative AI](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/7-top-generative-AI-benefits-for-business) chatbot-cum-assistant that makes it easy for users to draft content, simplify onerous tasks and speed up workflows.\\n\\nThe subscription plans for Microsoft 365 are available for the following:\\n\\n*   Home and personal use.\\n*   Small and midsize businesses.\\n*   Large enterprises.\\n*   Educational institutions.\\n*   Nonprofits.\\n\\nA free version, Microsoft 365 for the web _,_ is also available.Anyone with a Microsoft account can use it in a web browser. Securing the account only requires that users provide a new or existing email address.\\n\\n### Internet Explorer and Edge\\n\\nMicrosoft initially dismissed growing interest in the internet but nevertheless developed and released its first web browser in 1995, Internet Explorer ([IE](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterprisedesktop/definition/Internet-Explorer)). First appearing as an add-on in Windows 95, IE and its subsequent versions were bundled into the Windows OS. It was this decision that prompted the 1998 [antitrust case](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/opinion/Google-antitrust-case-could-explore-unknown-threats) against Microsoft. That case determined that Microsoft was deliberately stifling competition and building its monopoly in the web browser space. The courts initially ordered Microsoft to remove IE from Windows. However, both parties reached a settlement in 2001 that did not mandate this requirement. The courts ruled that Microsoft was an illegal monopoly and mandated that it make internal changes to eliminate this problem.\\n\\nMicrosoft continued development on IE, which remained available in Windows between 1995 and 2013. In 2016, the company stopped providing active technical support for all IE versions except IE 11. It also deprecated the browser in Windows 10 in favor of its newer [Edge](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Microsoft-Edge) browser. For a few years, Edge gained some traction among users. However, it slowly fell out of favor with them, many of whom preferred the more user-friendly, secure and feature-rich [Google Chrome](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/news/366616275/DOJs-push-to-breakup-Google-faces-tough-odds) and Mozilla Firefox browsers. In 2019, Microsoft adopted the Chrome-based browser engine from Google and applied its own enhancements.\\n\\nMicrosoft development platforms\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nMicrosoft has released numerous developer tools and programming languages since its origins as an OS-only company. [Visual Basic](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/tip/5-dead-programming-languages-we-should-never-forget), an object-oriented language for creating type-safe .NET apps, was released in 1991. Microsoft then expanded to Visual C++ in 1993 and eventually Visual C#, an implementation of the existing [C#](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/C-Sharp) language developed specifically for the .NET platform. In 2002, all these tools were bundled into Visual Studio.\\n\\nVisual Studio is an [IDE](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/integrated-development-environment) that helps software developers write, edit, debug and build code. It includes compilers, code completion tools, source control, extensions and other features that developers need to develop cross-platform applications in various languages, including [C++](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/C), C#, [JavaScript](https://www.theserverside.com/definition/JavaScript), TypeScript and [Python](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Python). The most recent versions of Visual Studio also provide AI assistance to help development teams streamline the [software development lifecycle](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/software-development-life-cycle-SDLC).\\n\\nAlso in 2002, Microsoft launched its .NET framework, a programming model to help developers build applications for Windows. The core components of the .NET platform are its [Common Language Runtime](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Common-Language-Runtime-CLR), which lets nearly any language compile down to an intermediate language, and the Framework Class Library, which provides core functions for any language.\\n\\nInitially designed for Windows-only development, .NET now covers non-Windows platforms such as [Linux](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterprisedesktop/tip/How-to-choose-between-Windows-10-IoT-and-Linux) and mobile. This led to platform fragmentation: .NET Framework, the original implementation; .NET Core, introduced in 2014 as the successor to Framework that added support for Linux and Mac; and Xamarin, a port of the .NET Framework for Android phones.\\n\\nIn 2019, Microsoft worked to combine .NET Framework, .NET Core and Xamarin into a single unified platform called .NET 5 Framework. That was released in 2020. As of 2025, .NET is an [open source](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/open-source) development platform that supports building many types of applications for Android, Apple, Linux and Windows OSes.\\n\\nMicrosoft management applications\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nMicrosoft develops and sells numerous enterprise-class systems management software tools, including [System Center](https://www.techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/definition/Microsoft-System-Center), which helps IT administrators deploy, configure, maintain and manage sophisticated corporate data center installations. System Center includes the following components and services:\\n\\n*   System Center Operations Manager for centralized monitoring of IT infrastructures.\\n*   System Center Orchestrator for simplifying data center workflow management.\\n*   System Center Virtual Machine Manager for configuring and managing virtualized, software-defined data centers.\\n*   System Center Service Manager to automate and improve IT service management practices.\\n*   System Center Data Protection Manager for securing data with backup, storage and recovery features.\\n\\nMicrosoft hardware offerings\\n----------------------------\\n\\nMicrosoft started its hardware division in 1982 to develop a mouse to use with Word. In 1995, it introduced its own keyboard with specific keys for controlling Windows 95.\\n\\nIn 2001, it launched the [Xbox gaming console](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252492522/Xbox-Series-X-PlayStation-5-launches-unleash-UK-network-traffic-surge) system as a direct competitor to established gaming companies such as Sony and Nintendo. Since then, Microsoft has released several other iterations of Xbox, including Xbox 360 in 2005, Xbox One in November 2013, and Xbox Series X and Series S in November 2020. Xbox Series X and Series S remain available as of January 2025 and support thousands of popular [video games](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/When-IT-Meets-Politics/Do-video-games-breed-hackers) like Star Wars Outlaws, Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and Age of Mythology Retold.\\n\\nMicrosoft also offers the Surface family of [tablet computers](https://www.computerweekly.com/microscope/news/366547016/Tablet-market-under-pressure?), which bundle tablet hardware with the Windows OS. The first Surface appeared in 2012 and has been superseded by several subsequent models. Besides tablets, other products in the touchscreen-based Surface line include laptops and whiteboards.\\n\\nMicrosoft Azure cloud\\n---------------------\\n\\nMicrosoft entered the [public cloud](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/definition/public-cloud) market when it introduced the Windows Azure platform at the Professional Developers Conference in October 2008. Azure became available in February 2010 as a competitor to [AWS](https://www.techtarget.com/searchaws/definition/Amazon-Web-Services). Built as an extension of the Windows NT OS, Azure set the stage for Microsoft\\'s foray into the area of [platform as a service](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/definition/Platform-as-a-Service-PaaS)\\n\\nThe company renamed the offering [Microsoft Azure](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/definition/Windows-Azure) in March 2014. As Microsoft\\'s public cloud computing platform, Azure provides various cloud services, including those for compute, analytics, storage, networking, management, [machine learning](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/machine-learning-ML) and [big data](https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/big-data) capabilities. Users can pick from these services to develop and scale new applications, or run existing applications in the public cloud.\\n\\nMuch of the appeal of Azure stems from it having the same operating environment as on-premises Windows Server. Customers can migrate their applications from on-premises to Azure, often without modification. Companies can also simplify infrastructure management through a global network of data centers Microsoft manages. Microsoft has also endeavored to make many of its key on-premises applications, such as SQL Server, have the same features in the cloud version as the on-premises version. Currently, the platform offers over 200 products and services, all accessible through the cloud for a wide range of enterprise applications and use cases. As with other Microsoft offerings, [Azure also includes AI capabilities](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366615541/Microsoft-ramps-up-small-language-model-effort) that make it easy for organizations to design and scale AI applications through a single interface.\\n\\nNotable Microsoft acquisitions\\n------------------------------\\n\\nLike most large corporations, Microsoft has acquired numerous companies over the years. here are some notable acquisitions:\\n\\n*   **Skype.**Microsoft purchased Skype, the [VoIP](https://www.techtarget.com/searchunifiedcommunications/definition/VoIP)-based video and text messaging service, from eBay in 2011 for $8.5 billion. Skype is now part of the Windows 11 OS and is used primarily in person-to-person communication, while Microsoft Teams is used for group conversation.\\n*   **Nokia.**Microsoft acquired [Nokia](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366613342/Nokia-sharpens-edge-for-industrial-communications) for $7.2 billion in 2013. At the time, Microsoft was competing in the smartphone business against Apple and Android, and Nokia was the largest supporter of the Windows Phone OS. But Windows Phone failed to gain traction, lost developers and was discontinued.\\n*   **LinkedIn.**In December 2016, Microsoft purchased the professional [social media](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/social-media) site LinkedIn for $26 billion. Recently, the company announced plans to tightly integrate LinkedIn with its video conferencing software, Microsoft Teams.\\n*   **Nuance Communications.** In April 2021, Microsoft announced it would spend $16 billion to acquire [Nuance Communications](https://www.techtarget.com/healthtechsecurity/news/366593951/Nuance-Communications-Notifies-12M-Individuals-of-Data-Breach), the leading maker of speech recognition software Dragon NaturallySpeaking.\\n*   **Activision Blizzard.** In January 2022, Microsoft sought to boost its position in the gaming industry with the $68 billion [acquisition of Activision Blizzard](https://www.techtarget.com/searchunifiedcommunications/news/252512262/Activision-Blizzard-deal-positions-Microsoft-for-the-metaverse), the maker of game franchises such as _Call of Duty_ and _Diablo_. Activision became a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft in October 2023. UK antitrust officials blocked the deal until August 2023, when Microsoft revised some elements of the deal to keep the company from eliminating competition in the cloud gaming market.\\n\\nMicrosoft leadership\\n--------------------\\n\\nMicrosoft has experienced several changes in leadership through the years.\\n\\nGates led Microsoft from its earliest days before handing over CEO duties in January 2000 to longtime friend and employee Steve Ballmer. Ballmer refocused the company on devices and services, leading to products such as Xbox and Office 365. He stepped down as CEO in February 2014 when he purchased the Los Angeles Clippers NBA team. In January 2015, Ballmer and his wife pledged to donate $15 million as emergency funding to help the people affected by [wildfires that raged across Los Angeles](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/news/366617924/Workforce-planning-lags-behind-rising-climate-disasters) for several weeks.\\n\\nAfter a protracted CEO search, Satya Nadella, who had been executive vice president of Microsoft\\'s cloud and enterprise division, became the new CEO in 2014.\\n\\nPaul Allen, one of Microsoft\\'s co-founders, died in 2018.\\n\\nFrom 2005 on, Gates [dedicated himself to his charitable foundation](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252480077/Bill-Gates-steps-down-from-Microsoft-board-to-focus-on-philanthropic-efforts), which he launched in 1994 with his then-wife, Melinda Gates. He pledged to donate virtually all his wealth to charity and remains heavily involved in the foundation that, as of 2020, was the world\\'s third-largest nonprofit. Although he is believed to still influence Microsoft\\'s strategic direction, he is no longer actively involved in day-to-day operations or decision-making.\\n\\n_Learn about the [differences between Windows 11 and Windows 10](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Windows-11-vs-Windows-10-What-are-the-differences) and explore the [features in the Windows Server 2022 editions](https://www.techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/tip/Compare-the-features-in-the-Windows-Server-2022-editions).

Its products are used by hundreds of millions of people every day, and its logo is one of the [most recognized around the world](https://www.bluleadz.com/blog/30-of-the-most-recognizable-brand-logos-of-all-time).\\n\\nHere, we explore Microsoft’s earliest days and answer some of the most commonly asked questions about the company. This article is, however, intended primarily as an overview of the company and not as a [comprehensive history](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Microsoft-Corporation).\\n\\n**[RELATED: THESE ARE THE FIVE LOGOS MICROSOFT HAS HAD THROUGHOUT THE YEARS](https://interestingengineering.com/these-are-the-five-logos-microsoft-has-had-throughout-the-years)**\\n\\nWhen and where did Microsoft start?\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nThe company that would eventually become [Microsoft](https://interestingengineering.com/microsoft-tests-a-renewable-energy-powered-data-center-at-the-bottom-of-the-ocean) was first founded by Bill Gates and [Paul Allen](https://interestingengineering.com/microsoft-co-founder-paul-allen-dies-at-age-65) in\\xa0Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1975.\\n\\nThe pair were avid programming enthusiasts from a young age. Building on their existing skills, they were inspired to produce their own programming language,\\xa0[Microsoft BASIC](https://time.com/69316/basic/), based on the existing language BASIC.\\n\\nTaking around eight weeks to compile, the pair of plucky entrepreneurs demonstrated BASIC for\\xa0Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS),\\xa0\\xa0the company that built the [Altair 8800 microcomputer](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_334396).\\n\\n![Image 4: microsoft history BASIC](https://images.interestingengineering.com/img/iea/PrO3jXZywq/history-of-microsoft-basic.jpg)\\n\\nExample of some BASIC code for the Commodore 64. _Source:\\xa0[Idealisierte Farben/Wikimedia Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC#/media/File:CommodoreBasic.png)_\\n\\nMITS liked what they saw and agreed to distribute and market the product under the name of Altair BASIC. This deal inspired Gates and Allen to found their own software company, and in April of 1975, Microsoft was born.\\n\\n“When we signed that first contract with MITS, we referred to ourselves as ‘Paul Allen and Bill Gates doing business as Micro-Soft.’ I don’t remember why we spelled it with a hyphen and a capital ‘S.’ We put a credit line in the source code of our first product that said, ‘Micro-Soft BASIC: Bill Gates wrote a lot of stuff; Paul Allen wrote some other stuff.\\'” – [Bill Gates](https://www.windowscentral.com/where-did-name-microsoft-come).\\n\\n![Image 5](https://images.interestingengineering.com/img/iea/PrO3jXZywq/history-of-microsoft.jpg)\\n\\n_Source:\\xa0[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/end-of-windows-7-support)_\\n\\nFrom that moment on, Microsoft would continue to grow until it eventually became the tech giant we all know (or\\xa0[love and hate](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/07/02/love_to_hate_microsoft/) in equal measures) today.\\n\\nWhat are some key dates in Microsoft’s history?\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\nProviding a comprehensive history of Microsoft is outside the scope of this article, but\\xa0according to Microsoft, here are some of the key early dates in the company’s rise to world domination.\\n\\n![Image 6: microsoft history building](https://images.interestingengineering.com/img/iea/zBwgVbej6K/microsoft-rural-connectivity-main.jpg)\\n\\n_Source:\\xa0[tomhoryn/iStock](https://www.istockphoto.com/es/foto/microsoft-gm496476627-41571632)_\\n\\nTrust us when we say this list is far from exhaustive.\\n\\nFor a fuller summary of Microsoft’s history, we recommend checking out [their official webpage](https://news.microsoft.com/facts-about-microsoft/#ImportantDates).\\n\\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width: 441px; height: 2234px;\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><colgroup><col width=\"100\"> <col width=\"100\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style=\"width: 115.2px; text-align: center;\" data-sheets-value=\"{\"><p><strong>Date</strong></p></td><td style=\"width: 318.933px; text-align: center;\" data-sheets-value=\"{\"><strong>Event</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 115.2px;\" data-sheets-value=\"{\">1975</td><td style=\"width: 318.933px;\" data-sheets-value=\"{\"><div><div>Microsoft is founded</div></div></td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 115.2px;\" data-sheets-value=\"{\" data-sheets-numberformat=\"{\">January 1979</td><td style=\"width: 318.933px;\" data-sheets-value=\"{\"><div><div>Microsoft moves from Albuquerque, New Mexico to Bellevue, Washington</div></div></td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 115.2px;\" data-sheets-value=\"{\" data-sheets-numberformat=\"{\">June 1981</td><td style=\"width: 318.933px;\" data-sheets-value=\"{\"><div><div>The company is officially incorporated</div></div></td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 115.2px;\" data-sheets-value=\"{\" data-sheets-numberformat=\"{\">August 1981</td><td style=\"width: 318.933px;\" data-sheets-value=\"{\"><div><div>IBM introduces its personal computer, which uses Microsoft’s 16-bit operating system and MS-DOS 1.0.</div></div></td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 115.2px;\" data-sheets-value=\"{\" data-sheets-numberformat=\"{\">Late-1985</td><td style=\"width: 318.933px;\" data-sheets-value=\"{\"><div><div>Windows 1.0 is launched.

The basic (pun intended) idea was mainly Paul Allen’s.\\n\\nIn what is now something of a legend, the idea for Microsoft came in a moment of [inspiration for Paul Allen](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Paul-Allen). Back in 1975, at the time, Gates was an undergraduate at Harvard University, and Allen worked for Honeywell Inc.\\xa0as a computer programmer.\\n\\nAllen, at the time 22-years old, purchased a copy of the January edition of [_Popular Electronics_](https://www.adwaterandstir.com/altair-history/). On the front cover was an image of the\\xa0World’s First Minicomputer Kit — the Altair 8800 microcomputer.\\n\\n![Image 7: history of microsoft popular electronics](https://images.interestingengineering.com/img/iea/PrO3jXZywq/history-of-microsoft-popular-electronics.jpg)\\n\\n_Source: [Computer Museum](http://www.computermuseum.20m.com/cgi-bin/i/images/popelec/Title.jpg)_\\n\\nAllen\\xa0[read the related article](http://www.computermuseum.20m.com/popelectronics.htm) and struck on an idea. With his copy of _Popular Electronics_ in hand, he decided to pay his school-friend Bill Gates a visit.\\n\\nThe two had been friends since their early days at Lakeside School (a private preparatory school in Seattle) and shared a passion for computers and programming. In fact, they had both become accomplished programmers and had been hired in 1971 to write a payroll program for Information Sciences, Inc. on behalf of\\xa0COBOL.\\n\\nAllen made his pitch to Gates. His idea was to adapt the\\xa0[Beginner’s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC)](https://techterms.com/definition/basic)\\xa0for the Altair 8800.\\n\\n[Gates](https://youtu.be/pqAg0GJLPGk) was impressed and liked the idea. He was also persuaded by Allen to leave Harvard to pursue their business idea.\\n\\nAt that time, microcomputers like the Altair 8800 executed source code provided by the machine’s compiler, but lacked an interpreter. Paul Allen proposed using BASIC to develop such an interpreter.\\n\\nIf successful, this BASIC-based interpreter would make machines like the 8800 very appealing to hobbyists and professional programmers around the world. Allen believed it would also enable the cost of microcomputers to fall dramatically, making [software development](https://interestingengineering.com/apps-software) a viable business on a larger scale.\\n\\n![Image 8: history of microsoft logo](https://images.interestingengineering.com/images/MARCH/Microsoft.jpg)\\n\\n_Source:\\xa0[Wonderlane/Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wonderlane/4335272889)_\\n\\nWith their pitch and interpreter prototype completed, the pair approached MITS to give an in-person demonstration.\\xa0Ed Roberts, the founder of MITS, agreed to the meeting, loved what he saw, and agreed to distribute a new machine which included their software – [Altair BASIC](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/31954/altair-basic).\\n\\nIn February of 1975, Allen and Gates sold their code to MITS for\\xa0**$3,000** (around\\xa0[**$14,000** today](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/)), plus a percentage of royalty payments (worth around **$840,000** today).\\n\\nThe same year “Micro-Soft” was officially registered as a company. The rest, as they say, is history.\\n\\nWhere did the Name Microsoft come from?\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nBack in 1975, Gates and Allen had mused over a few possible names for their new venture.\\n\\n“We had talked about a lot of different names back in Boston, and at some point, I said, ‘Well, the totally obvious name would be \\\\[Micro-Soft\\\\].\\'” – Paul Allen.\\n\\n![Image 9: history of microsoft office](https://images.interestingengineering.com/img/iea/lV6D2KdROx/sizes/microsoft-gdc_resize_md.jpg)\\n\\n_Source:\\xa0[jejim/iStock](https://www.istockphoto.com/tr/en/photo/microsoft-silicon-valley-center-mountain-view-ca-gm605772798-103870837)_\\n\\nBut there were other options on the table.\\n\\n“We also had mentioned names like _Outcorporated Inc_. and _Unlimited Ltd_., but we were, you know, joking around. We talked a lot about whether we should call it _Allen & Gates_, but decided that was not a good idea.” – Bill Gates.\\n\\nBut the name “Micro-Soft” stuck. It was created by Allen as a portmanteau of “microcomputer” and “software.”\\n\\nAfter officially forming a company, the pair would later open their first international office in Japan, called ASCII Microsoft, in 1977.\\n\\n#### RECOMMENDED ARTICLES\\n\\n \\n\\n[](https://www.outbrain.com/what-is/default/en)\\n\\nTwo years later, in 1979, the company relocated to\\xa0Bellevue, Washington, and eventually incorporated as Microsoft Inc. in 1981.\\n\\nBill Gates would take on the role of President of the company and Chairman of the Board, and Paul Allen became the company’s Executive Vice President.\\n\\nSo, there we go.\\n\\nToday, Microsoft has grown to be a world leader in the tech industry. From humble beginnings in the 1970s, hard work and attention to detail would create one of the most successful companies of all time.\\n\\n0COMMENT\\n\\n#### ABOUT THE AUTHOR\\n\\n[**Christopher McFadden**](https://interestingengineering.com/author/christopher-mcfadden) Christopher graduated from Cardiff University in 2004 with a Masters Degree in Geology.

We’re grateful for the feedback we received from our stakeholders around the world. Their insights have informed this second annual [Responsible AI Transparency Report](https://aka.ms/RAITransparencyReport2025), which underscores our continued commitment to building AI technologies that people trust. Our report highlights new developments related to how we build and deploy AI systems responsibly, how we support our customers and the broader ecosystem, and how we learn and evolve.\\n\\nThe past year has seen a wave of AI adoption by organizations of all sizes, prompting a renewed focus on effective AI governance in practice. Our customers and partners are eager to learn about how we have scaled our program at Microsoft and developed tools and practices that operationalize high-level norms.\\n\\nLike us, they have found that building trustworthy AI is good for business, and that good governance unlocks AI opportunities. According to [IDC’s Microsoft Responsible AI Survey](https://marketingassets.microsoft.com/gdc/gdcnUixiy/original) that gathered insights on organizational attitudes and the state of responsible AI, over 30% of the respondents note the lack of governance and risk management solutions as the top barrier to adopting and scaling AI. Conversely, more than 75% of the respondents who use responsible AI tools for risk management say that they have helped with data privacy, customer experience, confident business decisions, brand reputation, and trust.\\n\\nWe’ve also seen new regulatory efforts and laws emerge over the past year. Because we’ve invested in operationalizing responsible AI practices at Microsoft for close to a decade, we’re well prepared to comply with these regulations and to empower our customers to do the same. Our work here is not done, however.As we detail in the report, efficient and effective regulation and implementation practices that support the adoption of AI technology across borders are still being defined. We remain focused on contributing our practical insights to standard- and norm-setting efforts around the world.\\n\\nAcross all these facets of governance, it’s important to remain nimble in our approach, applying learnings from our real-world deployments, updating our practices to reflect advances in the state-of-the-art,and ensuring that we are responsive to feedback from our stakeholders. Learnings from our principled and iterative approach are reflected in the [pages of this report](https://aka.ms/Responsible-AI-Transparency-Report-2025). As our governance practices continue to evolve, we’ll proactively share our fresh insights with our stakeholders, both in future annual transparency reports and other public settings.\\n\\n### Key takeaways from our 2025 Transparency Report\\n\\nIn 2024, we made key investments in our responsible AI tools, policies, and practices to move at the speed of AI innovation.\\n\\n1.       1.   We improved our responsible AI tooling to provide expanded risk measurement and mitigation coverage for modalities beyond text—like images, audio, and video—and additional support for agentic systems, semi-autonomous systems that we anticipate will represent a significant area of AI investment and innovation in 2025 and beyond.\\n    2.   We took a proactive, layered approach to compliance with new regulatory requirements, including the European Union’s AI Act, and provided our customers with resources and materials that empower them to innovate in line with relevant regulations. Our early investments in building a comprehensive and industry-leading responsible AI program positioned us well to shift our AI regulatory readiness efforts into high gear in 2024.\\n    3.   We continued to apply a consistent risk management approach across releases through our pre-deployment review and red teaming efforts. This included oversight and review of high-impact and higher-risk uses of AI and generative AI releases, including every flagship model added to the Azure OpenAI Service and every Phi model release. To further support responsible AI documentation as part of these reviews, we launched an internal workflow tool designed to centralize the various responsible AI requirements outlined in the Responsible AI Standard.\\n    4.   We continued to provide hands-on counseling for high-impact and higher-risk uses of AI through our Sensitive Uses and Emerging Technologies team. Generative AI applications, especially in fields like healthcare and the sciences, were notable growth areas in 2024. By gleaning insights across cases and engaging researchers, the team provided early guidance for novel risks and emerging AI capabilities, enabling innovation and incubating new internal policies and guidelines.\\n    5.   We continued to lean on insights from research to inform our understanding of sociotechnical issues related to the latest advancements in AI. We established the AI Frontiers Lab to invest in the core technologies that push the frontier of what AI systems can do in terms of capability, efficiency, and safety.\\n    6.   We worked with stakeholders around the world to make progress towards building coherent governance approaches to help accelerate adoption and allow organizations of all kinds to innovate and use AI across borders. This included publishing a book exploring governance across various domains and helping advance cohesive standards for testing AI systems.\\n\\n### Looking ahead to the second half of 2025 and beyond\\n\\nAs AI innovation and adoption continue to advance,our core objective remains the same: earning the trust that we see as foundational to fostering broad and beneficial AI adoption around the world. As we continue that journey over the next year, we will focus on three areas to progress our steadfast commitment to AI governance while ensuring that our efforts are responsive to an ever-evolving landscape:\\n\\n1.   Developing more flexible and agile risk management tools and practices, while fostering skills development to anticipate and adapt to advances in AI. To ensure people and organizations around the world can leverage the transformative potential of AI, our ability to anticipate and manage the risks of AI must keep pace with AI innovation. This requires us to build tools and practices that can quickly adapt to advances in AI capabilities and the growing diversity of deployment scenarios that each have unique risk profiles. To do this, we will make greater investments in our systems of risk management to provide tools and practices for the most common risks across deployment scenarios, and also enable the sharing of test sets, mitigations, and other best practices across teams at Microsoft.\\n2.   Supporting effective governance across the AI supply chain. Building, earning, and keeping trust in AI is a collaborative endeavor that requires model developers, app builders, and system users to each contribute to trustworthy design, development, and operations. AI regulations, including the EU AI Act, reflect this need for information to flow across supply chain actors. While we embrace this concept of shared responsibility at Microsoft, we also recognize that pinning down how responsibilities fit together is complex, especially in a fast-changing AI ecosystem. To help advance shared understanding of how this can work in practice, we’re deepening our work internally and externally to clarify roles and expectations.\\n3.   Advancing a vibrant ecosystem through shared norms and effective tools, particularly for AI risk measurement and evaluation. The science of AI risk measurement and evaluation is a growing but still nascent field. We are committed to supporting the maturation of this field by continuing to make investments within Microsoft,including in research that pushes the frontiers of AI risk measurement and evaluation and the tooling to operationalize it at scale. We remain committed to sharing our latest advancements in tooling and best practices with the broader ecosystem to support the advancement of shared norms and standards for AI risk measurement and evaluation.\\n\\nWe look forward to hearing your feedback on the progress we have made and opportunities to collaborate on all that is still left to do. Together, we can advance AI governance efficiently and effectively, fostering trust in AI systems at a pace that matches the opportunities ahead.\\n\\nExplore the [2025 Responsible AI Transparency

We had a solid close to our fiscal year. All up annual revenue was more than $245,000,000,000 up 15% year over year and Microsoft Cloud revenue surpassed $135,000,000,000 up 23%. Before I dive in, I want to offer some broader perspective on the AI platform shift. Similar to the cloud, this transition involves both knowledge and capital intensive investments.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:03:33\\n\\nAnd as we go through this shift, we are focused on 2 fundamental things. First, driving innovation across a product portfolio that spans infrastructure and applications so as to ensure that we are maximizing our opportunity, while in parallel continuing to scale our cloud business and prioritizing fundamentals starting with security. 2nd, using customer demand signal and time to value to manage our cost structure dynamically and generate durable long term operating leverage. With that, let me highlight examples starting with Azure. Our share gains accelerated this year driven by AI.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:04:15\\n\\nWe expanded our data center footprint announcing investments across 4 continents. These are long term assets around the world to drive growth for the next decade and beyond. We added new AI accelerators from AMD and NVIDIA as well as our own first party silicon Azure Maya and we introduced new Cobalt 100 which provides best in class performance for customers like Elastic, MongoDB, Siemens, Snowflake and Teradata. We continue to see sustained revenue growth from migrations. Azure Arc is helping customers in every industry from ABB and Cathay Pacific to La Liga to streamline their cloud migrations.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:04:56\\n\\nWe now have 36,000 ARC customers up 90% year over year. We remain the hyperscale cloud of choice for SAP and Oracle workloads. Atos, Kohl's, Daimler Truck AG, Domino's, Halion, for example, all migrated their mission critical SAP workloads to our cloud. And with our Azure VMware solution, we offer the fastest and most cost effective way for customers to migrate their VMware workloads to. With Azure AI, we are building out the app server for the AI wave, providing access to the most diverse selection of models to meet customers' unique cost, latency and design considerations.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:05:39\\n\\nAll up, we now have over 60,000 Azure AI customers up nearly 60% year over year and average spend per customer continues to grow. Azure OpenAI service provides access to best in class frontier models including as of this quarter GPT 4.0 and GPT 4.0 Mini. It's being used by leading companies in every industry, including H and R Block, Suzuki, Swiss Re, Telstra, as well as digital natives like Freshworks, Meesho and Zomato. With 5.3, we offer a family of powerful small language models which are being used by companies like BlackRock, Emirates, Epic, ITC, Navy Federal Credit Union and others. And with models as a service, we provide API access to 3rd party models including as of last week the latest from Cohere, Meta and Mistral.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:06:34\\n\\nThe number of paid models as a service customers more than doubled quarter over quarter and we are seeing increased usage by leaders in every industry from Adobe and Bridgestone to Novo Nordisk and Palantir. Now on to data. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform provides customers with the broadest capabilities spanning databases, analytics, business intelligence and governance along with seamless integration with all of our AI services. The number of Azure AI customers also using our data and analytics tools grew nearly 50% year over year. Microsoft Fabric, our AI powered next generation data platform, now has over 14,000 paid customers, including leaders in every industry from Accenture and Kroger to Rockwell Automation and Zeiss, up 20% quarter over quarter.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:07:27\\n\\nAnd this quarter, we introduced new first of their kind real time intelligence capabilities in fabrics, so customers can unlock insights on high volume time sensitive data. Now on to developer tools. GitHub Copilot is by far the most widely adopted AI powered developer tool. Just over 2 years since its general availability, more than 77,000 organizations from BBVA, FedEx and H and M to Infosys and Paytm have adopted CoPilot, up 180% year over year. And we're going further with CoPilot Workspace, we offer CoPilot native end to end developer productivity across plan, build, test, debug and deploy cycle.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:08:13\\n\\nCoPilot is driving GitHub growth all up. GitHub annual revenue run rate is now $2,000,000,000 Copilot accounted for over 40% of GitHub revenue growth this year and is already a larger business than all of GitHub was when we acquired it. We are also integrating generative AI across Power Platform enabling anyone to use natural language to create apps, automate workflows or build a website. To date, over 480,000 organizations have used AI powered capabilities in Power Platform, up 45% quarter over quarter. In total, we now have 48,000,000 monthly active users of Power Platform, up 40% year over year.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:08:55\\n\\nNow on to future of work. Co pilot for Microsoft 365 is becoming a daily habit for knowledge workers as it transforms work, workflow and work artifacts. The number of people who use Copilot daily at work nearly doubled quarter over quarter as they use it to complete tasks faster, hold more more effective meetings and automate business workflows and processes. CoPilot customers increased more than 60% quarter over quarter. Feedback has been positive with majority of enterprise customers coming back to purchase more seats.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:09:29\\n\\nAll up, the number of customers with more than 10,000 seats more than doubled quarter over quarter, including Capital Group, Disney, Dow, Kendrel, Novartis and alone will deploy CoPilot to 150,000 of its employees. And we are going further adding agent capabilities to CoPilot. New team CoPilot can facilitate meetings and create and assign tasks. And with CoPilot Studio, customers can extend CoPilot for Microsoft 365 and build custom CoPilots that proactively respond to data and events using their own first and third party business data. To date, 50,000 organizations from Carnival Corporations, Cognizant and Eaton to KPMG, Majesco and McKinsey have used CoPilot Studio up over 70% quarter over quarter.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:10:25\\n\\nWe're also extending CoPilot to specific industries including healthcare with DAX CoPilot more than 400 health care organizations, including Community Health Network, Intermountain, Northwestern Memorial Healthcare and Ohio State University, Wexner Medical Center have purchased Dax CoPilot to date, up 40% quarter over quarter and the number of AI generated clinical reports more than tripled. Copilot is also transforming ERP and CRM business applications. We again took share this quarter as customers like Thermo Fisher Scientific switched to Dynamics. Our new Dynamics 365 Contact Center is a Copilot First solution that infuses generative AI throughout the contact center workflow. Companies like 1-eight 100 Flowers, Mediterranean Shipping, Synoptec will rely on it to deliver better customer support.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:11:17\\n\\nAnd Dynamics 365 Business Central is now trusted by over 40,000 organizations for core ERP. Microsoft Teams has become essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate and do business. We once again saw year over year usage growth. Teams Premium has surpassed 3,000,000 seats, up nearly 400 percent year over year as organizations like Dentsu, Eli Lilly and Ford chose it for advanced features like end to end encryption and real time translation. When it comes to devices, we introduced our new category of CoPilot Plus PCs this quarter.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:12:00\\n\\nThey are the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever. They include a new system architecture designed to deliver best in class performance and breakthrough AI experiences. We are delighted by early reviews and we are looking forward to the introduction of more CoPilot Plus PCs powered by all of our silicon and OEM partners in the coming months. More broadly, Windows 11 active devices increased 50% year over year and we are seeing accelerated adoption of Windows 11 by companies like Carlsberg, E. ON, National Australia Bank.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:12:36\\n\\nAnd now on to security. We continue to prioritize security above all else. We are doubling down on our Secure Future initiative as we implement our principles of secure by design, secure by default and secure operations. Through this initiative, we are also continually applying what we are learning and translating it into innovation for our customers, including how we approach AI. Over 1,000 paid customers used CoPilot for security, including Alaska Airlines, Oregon State University, Petrofac, Wipro, WTW and we are also securing customers' AI deployments with updates to Defender and Purview.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:13:18\\n\\nAll up, we now have 1,200,000 secondurity customers over 800,000 including Dell Technologies, Deutsche Telekom, TomTom used 4 or more workloads, up 25% year over year. And Defender for Cloud, solution surpassed $1,000,000,000 in revenue over the past 12 months as we protect customer workloads across multi cloud and hybrid environments. Now let me turn to our consumer businesses starting with LinkedIn. LinkedIn continues to see accelerated member growth and record engagement. 1,500,000 pieces of content are shared every minute on the platform and video is now the fastest growing format on LinkedIn with uploads up 34% year over year.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:14:06\\n\\nLinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message to the right audience on a safe trusted platform. And when it comes to our subscription businesses, premium sign ups increased 51% this fiscal year and we are adding even more value to our members and customers with new AI AI tools. Our reimagined AI powered LinkedIn premium experience is now available for every premium subscriber worldwide, And now on to search, advertising and news. We are in And now on to search, advertising and news. We are ensuring that Bing, Edge and CoPilot collectively TAC increased 19% year over year and we again TAC increased 19% year over year and we again took share across Bing and Edge.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:15:05\\n\\nWe continue to apply generative AI to pioneer new approaches to how people search and browse. Just last week, we announced we are testing a new generative search experience, which creates a dynamic response to users' query while maintaining click share to publishers. And we continue to drive record engagement with Copilot for the web. Consumers have used Copilot to create over 12,000,000,000 images and conduct 13,000,000,000 chats to date, up 150% since the start of the calendar year. Thousands of news and entertainment publishers trust us to reach new audiences with Microsoft Start, and in fact, we have paid them $1,000,000,000 over the last 5 years.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:15:48\\n\\nWe are helping advertisers increase their ROI too. We have seen positive ad platform helps marketeers create campaigns and troubleshoot using natural language. Now on to gaming. We now have over 500,000,000 monthly active users across platforms and devices and our content pipeline has never been stronger. We previewed a record 30 new titles at our showcase this quarter, 18 of them such as Call of Duty, Black Ops 6 will be available on Game Pass.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:16:29\\n\\nGame Pass Ultimate subscribers can now stream games directly on devices they already have including as of last month Amazon Fire TVs. Finally, we are bringing our IP to new audiences. Fallout, for example, made its debut as a TV show on Amazon Prime this quarter. It was the 2nd most watched title on the platform ever and hours played on Game Pass for the Fallout franchise increased nearly 5x quarter over quarter. In closing, I'm energized about the opportunities ahead.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:17:03\\n\\nWe are investing for the long term in our fundamentals, in our innovation and in our people. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:17:12\\n\\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $64,700,000,000 up 15% 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.95 and increased 10% 11% in constant currency. In our largest quarter of the year, we again delivered double digit top and bottom line growth with continued share gains across many of our businesses and record commitments to our Microsoft Cloud Platform. Commercial bookings were significantly ahead of expectations and increased 17% and 19% in constant currency.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:17:48\\n\\nThis record commitment quarter was driven by growth in the number $10,000,000 plus $100,000,000 plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365 and consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 20% 21% in constant currency to $269,000,000,000 Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 18% year over year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 21%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 97%. At a company level, Activision contributed net impact of approximately 3 points to revenue growth, was a 2 point drag on operating income growth and had a negative $0.06 impact to earnings per share.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:18:38\\n\\nA reminder that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from prior relationship as a 3rd party partner to 1st party and includes $938,000,000 from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction related costs. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $36,800,000,000 and grew 21% 22% in constant currency, roughly in line with expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points year over year to 69%, in line with expectations. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by improvement in Azure even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:19:35\\n\\nCompany gross margin dollars increased 14% 15% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year over year to 70%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly even with the impact from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction related costs from the Activision acquisition. Operating expenses increased 13% with 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, headcount at the end of June was 3% higher than a year ago. Operating income increased 15% and 16% in constant currency and operating margins were 43%, relatively unchanged year over year.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:20:19\\n\\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased slightly driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier and improved operating leverage through continued cost discipline. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $20,300,000,000 and grew 11% and 12% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations, driven by better than expected results across all business units. Office Commercial revenue grew 12% 13% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 13% 14% in constant currency with ARPU growth primarily from E5 momentum as well as CoPilot for Microsoft 365.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:21:02\\n\\nPaid Office 365 commercial seats grew 7% year over year with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although both segments continued to moderate. Office Commercial Licensing declined 9% and 7% in constant currency with continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office Consumer revenue increased 3% 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 Subscriptions, which grew 10% to $82,500,000 LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, driven by better than expected performance across all businesses. Dynamics revenue grew 16%, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 19% 20% in constant currency.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:21:54\\n\\nWe saw continued growth across all workloads and better than expected new business. Dynamics 365 now represents roughly 90% of total Dynamics revenue. Segment gross margin dollars increased 9% and in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year over year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by Office 365 as we scale our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 5% and operating income increased 12% 13% in constant currency.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:22:31\\n\\nNext, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $28,500,000,000 increasing 19% 20% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue grew 21% 22% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud Services revenue grew 29% 30% in constant currency, in line with expectations and consistent with Q3 when adjusting for leap year. Azure growth included 8 points from AI Services where demand remained higher than our available capacity.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:23:06\\n\\nIn June, we saw slightly lower than expected growth in a few European geos. In our per user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 10% to over 281,000,000 seats with continued impact from moderated growth in seats sold outside the Microsoft 365 Suite. Therefore, our Azure consumption business continues to grow faster than total Azure. In our on premises server business, revenue increased 2% 3% in constant currency. Growth was driven by demand for our hybrid solutions, although with slightly lower than expected transactional purchasing.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:23:44\\n\\nEnterprise and Partner Services revenue decreased 7% on a strong prior year comparable for Enterprise Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points year over year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by the improvement in Azure noted earlier even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 5% and operating income grew 22% and 23% in constant currency. Now to more personal computing.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:24:21\\n\\nRevenue was $15,900,000,000 increasing 14% 15% in constant currency with 12 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations driven by Windows Commercial and Search. The PC market was as expected and Windows OEM revenue increased 4% year over year. Windows Commercial Products and Cloud Services revenue increased 11% 12% in constant currency ahead of expectations due to higher end period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. Devices revenue decreased 11% 9% in constant currency, roughly in line with expectations as we remain focused on our higher margin premium products.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:25:01\\n\\nWhile early days, we're excited about the recent launch of our CoPilot Plus PCs. Search and News advertising revenue ex TAC increased 19% ahead of expectations, primarily due to improved execution. Healthy volume growth was driven by Bing and Edge. And in Gaming, revenue increased 44% with 48 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61% slightly ahead of expectations with 58 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:25:34\\n\\nStronger than expected performance in 1st party content was partially offset by 3rd party content performance. Xbox hardware revenue decreased 42% 41% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 21% with 10 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points year over year, primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 43% with 41 points from the Activision acquisition.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:26:05\\n\\nOperating income increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $19,000,000,000 in line with expectations and cash paid for PP and E was $13,900,000,000 Cloud and AI related spend represents nearly all of our total capital expenditures. Within that, roughly half is for infrastructure needs where we continue to build and lease data centers that will support monetization over the next 15 years beyond. The remaining cloud and AI related spend is primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs to serve customers based on demand signals.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:26:46\\n\\nFor the full fiscal year, the mix of our cloud and AI related spend was similar to Q4. Cash flow from operations was $37,200,000,000 up 29 percent driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $23,300,000,000 up 18% year over year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings. For the full year, cash flow from operations surpassed $100,000,000,000 for the first time, reaching $119,000,000,000 This quarter, other income expense was negative $675,000,000 more favorable than anticipated with lower than expected interest expense and higher than expected interest income. Our losses on investments accounted for under the equity method were as expected.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:27:36\\n\\nOur effective tax rate was approximately 19%, higher than anticipated due to a state tax law signed in June that was effective retroactively. And finally, we returned $8,400,000,000 to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, bringing our total cash return to shareholders to over $34,000,000,000 for the full fiscal year. Now moving to our outlook. My commentary for both the full year and next quarter is on a U. S.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:28:03\\n\\nDollar basis unless specifically noted otherwise. Let me start with some full year commentary for FY 2025. First, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to have no meaningful impact to full year revenue, COGS or operating expense growth. Next, we continue to expect double digit revenue and operating income growth as we focus on delivering differentiated value for our customers.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:28:29\\n\\nTo meet the growing demand signal for our AI and cloud products, we will scale our infrastructure investments with FY 2025 capital expenditures expected to be higher than FY 2024. As a reminder, these expenditures are dependent on demand signals and adoption of our services that will be managed through the year. As scaling these investments drives growth in COGS, we will remain disciplined on operating expense management. Therefore, we expect FY 'twenty five OpEx growth to be in the single digits. And given our focused commitment to managing at the operating margin level, we still expect FY 2025 operating margins to be down only about 1 point year over year.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:29:13\\n\\nAnd finally, we expect our FY 2025 effective tax rate to be around 19%. Now to the outlook for our Q1. Based on current rates, we expect FX to decrease total revenue and segment level revenue growth by less than 1 point. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by less than one point and to have no meaningful impact to operating expense growth. In Commercial Bookings, increased long term commitments to our platform and strong execution across core annuity sales motions should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:29:48\\n\\nAs a reminder, larger long term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 70%, down year over year, driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. We expect capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis given our cloud and AI demand as well as existing AI capacity constraints. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next is segment guidance.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:30:25\\n\\nIn Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 10% 11% in constant currency or US20.3 billion dollars to US20.6 billion dollars In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5 and Copilot for Microsoft 365. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency. In our on premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high teens. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 Subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits, driven by continued growth across all businesses.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:31:09\\n\\nAnd in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 18% 20% in constant currency or $28,600,000,000 to $28,900,000,000 Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which as a reminder can have quarterly variability primarily from our per user business and in period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth to be 28% to 29% in constant currency. Growth will continue to be driven by our consumption business inclusive of AI, which is growing faster than total Azure. We expect the consumption trends from Q4 to continue through the first half of the year.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:31:58\\n\\nThis includes both AI demand impacted by capacity constraints and non AI growth trends similar to June. Growth in our per user business will continue to moderate. And in H2, we expect Azure growth to accelerate as our capital investments create an increase in available AI capacity to serve more of the growing demand. In our on premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low single digits as continued hybrid demand will be more than offset by lower transactional purchasing. And in Enterprise and Partner Services, revenue should decline in the low single digits.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:32:33\\n\\nIn More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 9% 12% constant currency or $14,900,000,000 to $15,300,000,000 Windows OEM revenue growth should be relatively flat, roughly in line with the PC market. In Windows Commercial Products and Cloud Services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our Advanced Security Solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In devices revenue growth should be in the low to mid single digits. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the mid to high teens.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:33:14\\n\\nThis will be higher than overall Search and News Advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be in the low single digits. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid-30s, including approximately 40 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low to mid-50s driven by the net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will again decline year over year. Now back to company guidance.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:33:39\\n\\nWe expect COGS between US19.95 billion dollars to US20.15 billion dollars including approximately $700,000,000 from purchase accounting, integration and transaction related costs from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expense of 15 point $2,000,000,000 to $15,300,000,000 including approximately $200,000,000 from purchase accounting, integration and transaction related costs from the Activision acquisition. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $650,000,000 driven by losses on investments accounted for under the equity method as interest income will be mostly offset by interest expense. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:34:29\\n\\nIn closing, we remain focused on delivering innovations that matter to our global customers of every size. That focus extends to delivering on our financial commitments as well. We delivered operating margin growth of nearly 3 points year over year, even as we accelerate our AI investments, completed the Activision acquisition and had a headwind from the change in useful lives last year. So as we begin FY 'twenty five, we will continue to invest in the cloud and AI opportunity ahead, aligned and if needed, adjusted to the demand signals we see. We are committed to growing our leadership across our commercial cloud and within that the AI platform, And we feel well positioned as we start FY 'twenty five.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:35:14\\n\\nWith that, let's go to Q and A, Brett.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\n\\n00:35:17\\n\\nThanks, Davey. We'll now move over to Q and A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n00:35:51\\n\\nAnd our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\n\\n00:35:56\\n\\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on another great quarter and really solid overall fiscal year. Right now, there's a industry debate raging around the CapEx requirements around generative AI and whether the monetization is actually going to match with that. And I think the question for you guys from a Microsoft perspective is CapEx still an appropriate leading indicator for cloud growth or do the shifting gross margin profiles change that equation? Or said another way, maybe can you give us a little bit more help in understanding the timing between the CapEx investments and the yields on those investments?\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\n\\n00:36:39\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:36:41\\n\\nThank you, Keith. Let me start and then Amy can add to this. I think I would say we primarily start right now from the demand side. What I mean by that is, what's the product shape of the product portfolio, what we learned even from the cloud transition, which as you know, Keith was similar in the sense it was both a knowledge intensive and capital intensive transition. We needed to have the product portfolio where there was the right mix of, I'll call it, infrastructure, meters as well as SaaS applications.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:37:15\\n\\nSo that's the first thing that we are looking at. And how is that value landing M365 Copilot as perhaps the best Office 365 or M365 Suite we have had. The fact that we're getting recurring customers, so customers coming back, buying more seats. So GitHub Copilot now being bigger than even GitHub when we bought it, what's happening in the contact center with Dynamics. So I would say and obviously the Azure AI growth, that's the first place we look at.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:37:51\\n\\nThat then drives bulk of the CapEx spend. Basically, that's the demand signal, Because you got to remember, even in the capital spend, there is land and there is data center build, but 60% plus is the kit. That only will be bought for inferencing and everything else if there is demand signal, right. So that's I think the key way to think about capital cycle even. The asset, as Amy said, is a long term asset, which is land and the data center, which by the way, we don't even construct things fully.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:38:23\\n\\nWe can even have things which are semi constructed, we call coal shells and so on. So we know how to manage our CapEx spend to build out a long term asset. And a lot of the hydration of the kid happens when we have the demand signal. There is definitely spend for training. Even there, of course, we will only be scaling training as we see the demand accrue in any given period in time.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:38:47\\n\\nSo I would say it's more important to manage to capture the opportunity with the right product portfolio that's driving value. And on that front, I feel good about the breadth of Microsoft offering, whether it's in consumer side, whether it's in commercial per seat side or on the consumption meters, that's I think the fundamental driver.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:39:07\\n\\nAnd Keith, I do think and I really do appreciate how you phrased the question as well because I think the timing and some of the questions you all have had really led to how we were talking even about capital expense in our comments and in my comments today. Being able to maybe share a little more about that, when we talked about roughly half of FY 2020 four's total capital expense as well as half of Q4's expense, it's really on land and build and finance leases. And those things really will be monetized over 15 years and beyond. And they're incredibly flexible, because we've built a consistent architecture, 1st with the commercial cloud and second with the Azure Stack for AI, regardless of whether demand is at the platform layer or at the app layer or through 3rd parties and partners or frankly, our first party SaaS, it uses the same infrastructure. So, it's got long lived flexible assets.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:40:14\\n\\nAnd if you think about it that way, you can see what we're doing and focused on is building out this network in parallel across the globe, because when we did this last transition, the first transition to the cloud, which seems a long time ago sometimes, it rolled out quite differently. We rolled out more geo by geo. And this one, because we have demand on a global basis, we are doing it on a global basis, which is important. We have large customers in every geo. And so hopefully with that sort of shape of our capital expense, it helps people see how much of that is sort of near term monetization driver as well as a much longer duration.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\n\\n00:41:03\\n\\nThat's super helpful. Thank you very much.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\n\\n00:41:05\\n\\nThanks, Keith. Operator, next question please.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n00:41:09\\n\\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\\n\\nSpeaker 5\\n\\n00:41:16\\n\\nThank you very much. Thank you for taking the question and congrats on\\n\\nSpeaker 6\\n\\n00:41:20\\n\\na strong year. GenAI has been a bit of\\n\\nSpeaker 5\\n\\n00:41:22\\n\\na roller coaster with tech over the last year with periods of acceleration, high expectations and the expectations drop as reality kicked in. With Azure growth we've seen this quarter and O365 commercial not yet fully visible in numbers even though Amy you gave us a lot of color on it. Two quick parts to the question. Satya, how should we think about what it's going to take for GenAI to become more real across the industry and for it to become more visible within your SaaS offerings? And Amy, with cloud, it took time for margins to improve.\\n\\nSpeaker 5\\n\\n00:41:58\\n\\nIt looks like with AI, it's happening quicker.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:42:02\\n\\nCan you give us a sense\\n\\nSpeaker 5\\n\\n00:42:03\\n\\nof how you think about the margin impact near term and long term from all the investment on AI? Thank you.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:42:11\\n\\nYes. Thanks again, Mark for the question. So to me, look at the end of the day, Gen AI is just software. So it is really translating into fundamentally growth on what has been our M365 SaaS offering with a new offering that is the co pilot SaaS offering, which today is on a growth rate that's faster than any other previous generation of software we launched as a suite in M365. That's I think the best way to describe it.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:42:43\\n\\nI mean, the numbers I think we shared even this quarter are indicative of this, Mark. So if you look at it, we have both the landing of the seats itself quarter over quarter that is growing 60%, right. That's a pretty good healthy sign. The most healthy sign for me is the fact that customers are coming back there. That is the same customers with whom we landed the seats coming back and buying more seats.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:43:07\\n\\nAnd then the number of customers with 10,000 plus seats doubled, right, it's 2x quarter over quarter. That to me is a healthy SaaS core business. And on top of that, some of the things that Amy shared are on dynamic. That's another exciting place for us, which is, 1, we're gaining share. We're dynamics with the Gen AI built in is sort of really biz apps is probably the category that gets completely transformed with Gen AI.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:43:36\\n\\nContact centers being a great example. We ourselves are on course to save 100 of 1,000,000 of dollars in our own customer support and contact center operations. So I think we can drive that value to our customers. And then on the Azure side, you see the numbers very clearly. In fact, I think last quarter is when we started giving you that you saw an acceleration of that this quarter.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:43:59\\n\\nOne of the other pieces, Mark, is AI doesn't sit on its own, right? So it's just we have a concept of design wins in Azure. So in fact, 50% of the folks who are using Azure AI are also using a data meter. That's very exciting to us because the most important thing in Azure is to win workloads in the enterprise. And that is starting to happen.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:44:25\\n\\nAnd these are generational things once they get going with you. So that's I think how we think about it at least when I look at what's happening on our demand side.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:44:35\\n\\nAnd Mark, to answer the second half of your question on margin improvement looking different than it did through the last cloud cycle, That's primarily for a reason I've mentioned a couple of times. We have a consistent platform. So because we're building to 1 Azure AI stack, we don't have to have multiple infrastructure investments. We're making 1. We're using that internally first party and that's what we're using with customers to build on as well as ISVs.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:45:05\\n\\nSo it does in fact make margins start off better and obviously scale consistently.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n00:45:21\\n\\nThe next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\\n\\nSpeaker 7\\n\\n00:45:27\\n\\nHi, thank you very much and congrats on a great fiscal year ending. Question for you, Amy, when you look at the CapEx, how do you bring efficiencies out of the CapEx you've disclosed at 50% of that was infrastructure, the other 50% tech is very useful. So in other words, do you have to keep growing CapEx at these elevated rates? Or could you slow down CapEx and still get that consistent revenue growth rate in your Azure and generative AI? That's the main question on my mind.\\n\\nSpeaker 7\\n\\n00:45:55\\n\\nThank you so much.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:45:57\\n\\nThanks, Kash. That's a very good question. There's really 2 pieces, I think, as I heard your question that I would reflect on. The first is, could we see sort of consistent revenue growth without maybe what you would say is more of this sort of elevated capital expense number or something that continues to accelerate? And the answer to that is yes, because there's 2 different pieces, right?\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:46:23\\n\\nYou're seeing half of this go toward long term builds that Satya mentioned. The pace at which we fill those builds with CPUs or GPUs will be demand driven. And so if we see differences in demand signal, we can throttle that investment on the CPU side, which we've done for, I guess, a long time at this point, as I reflect. And we'll use all that same learning and demand signal understand to do the same thing on the GPU side. And so you're right that you could see relatively consistent revenue patterns and yet see these inconsistencies and capital spend quarter to quarter.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:47:05\\n\\nThe other thing I would note, Kash, is you'll also notice there's a growing distinction between our CapEx number and on occasion the cash that we pay for PP and E. And you're going to start to see that more often in this period, because it happens when we use leases. Leases sort of show up all at once. And so you'll see a little bit more volatility. I've mentioned that in my comments before, but I mentioned again just because you're starting to see that distinction in my comments and hopefully that's helpful context.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:47:38\\n\\nJust one other thing Amy if I wanted to add. I think as people think about capital spend, I think it's important to separate out leases from build. And when it comes to build, I think it's important for us to think about we think about it in terms of what's the total percentage of cost that goes into each line item, land, which obviously has a very different duration and a very different lead time. So those are the other two considerations. We think about lead time and duration of the asset, land, network, construction, the system or the kit, and then the ongoing cost.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:48:12\\n\\nAnd so if you think about it that way, then you know how to even adjust, if you will, the capital spend based on demand signal.\\n\\nSpeaker 7\\n\\n00:48:19\\n\\nThank you. It was triggered by the jump in CapEx. And as Emmy pointed out, you're guiding to accelerating Azure revenue growth rate, which I guess follows the CapEx search. Thank you so much once again.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\n\\n00:48:30\\n\\nThanks, Kash. Operator, next question please.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n00:48:34\\n\\nThe next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\\n\\nSpeaker 6\\n\\n00:48:40\\n\\nThanks. Amy, the magnitude of beat this quarter was a little lower than we've seen in the past. Was there anything unusual on the sales cycle, the close rate that you saw? Thanks.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:48:52\\n\\nThanks, Brent. Actually, no. As I was talking on the corner, I mean, commercial bookings were much better than we expected going into the quarter. Commitments were very good, execution across both the core sort of annuity renewal motion was good as expected. The larger long term commitments were better than we expected.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:49:21\\n\\nSo, Britt, I would not say there was anything really unusual in how I thought about and what we saw in our commercial execution through the quarter.\\n\\nSpeaker 6\\n\\n00:49:36\\n\\nGreat. Thank you.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\n\\n00:49:38\\n\\nThanks, Brent. Operator, next question please.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n00:49:42\\n\\nThe next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.\\n\\nSpeaker 6\\n\\n00:49:48\\n\\nOkay, great. So maybe I'll direct this to Amy. Amy, I know when you set your Azure guidance, you're always looking to meet or beat the high end. The 30% you put up in the June quarter, amazing number given the scale of Azure, but it did come in at the low end of your range. And I'd just love for you to maybe elaborate on the delta.\\n\\nSpeaker 6\\n\\n00:50:09\\n\\nI guess as I reflect on what you've said in your comments, there's 2 things that I heard you say. 1, it sounded like there's persistent capacity constraints that you think might get alleviated in the second half. And then secondly, you mentioned perhaps some modest softness in Europe. I presume that's a little bit more economic rather than Azure specific. Is that the right way to frame the performance in the quarter?\\n\\nSpeaker 6\\n\\n00:50:35\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:50:38\\n\\nThanks, Carl. Yes, that's exactly right. Maybe I'll just repeat it just so people can hear it in my words as well. To that 30% to 31% guide for Q4 and coming in at the lower end of 30. You're exactly right.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:50:54\\n\\nThe distinguishing between being at the higher end or at the lower end really was some softness we saw in a few European geos on non AI consumption really made the difference in that number. And we've assumed that going forward into H1, inclusive of my guided 28% to 29% going forward. And then let me separate, which was your larger point, which is one of the other factors you see ongoing. Number 1, you're right, capacity constraints, particularly on AI and Azure will remained in Q4 and will remain in H1. So hopefully, that's helpful.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:51:43\\n\\nYes. Thank you, Amy.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\n\\n00:51:46\\n\\nThanks, Carl. Operator, next question please.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n00:51:50\\n\\nThe next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\\n\\nSpeaker 6\\n\\n00:51:56\\n\\nGreat. Thank you very much. Amy, with Azure demand once again greater than available capacity, I appreciate the CapEx investments and the build out and acceleration you expect in the back half. But as we think about cloud capacity and AI services specifically, can you talk about both the near term and long term strategy around the AI partnerships that you're signing with the likes of Oracle and CorWee, for example? Thank you.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:52:23\\n\\nThanks, Brad. Maybe separate a couple of things. We are and we've talked about it now for quite a few quarters. We are constrained on AI capacity. And because of that, actually we've to your point, have signed up with 3rd parties to help us as we are behind with some leases on AI capacity.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:52:48\\n\\nWe've done that with partners who are happy to help us extend the Azure platform to be able to serve this Azure AI demand. And you do see us investing quite a bit, as we've talked about in builds, so that we can get back in a more balanced place.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:53:06\\n\\nYes, I mean to me it's no different than leases that we would have done in the past. These you would even say sometimes buying from Oracle maybe even more efficient leases because they're even shorter\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n00:53:26\\n\\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\\n\\nSpeaker 6\\n\\n00:53:32\\n\\nThank you very much. With a couple of quarters of co pilot for M365 availability under your belt now, How are you assessing the capability of CoPilot to replicate the productivity gains that they've created for developers, which seem to be very high, and to do something similar for the broader population of knowledge workers? For instance, you're mentioning the 10,000 seat deals, the repeat purchases. Is it possible to eventually see Copilot penetration rates equally high in office as they will be in GitHub?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:54:09\\n\\nYes, that's a great question. In fact, the GitHub design system create a plan, from a plan you create a spec or you create a spec and from a spec you create a plan and then you go operate across the full repo. That's effectively the design system that is getting replicated inside of even the M365 Copilot. And you see this even now. For example, you get an email, you're in sales, you want to respond to the customer, the data from the email is essentially context for a prompt, but you expand by bringing in all of your CRM data, right.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:54:59\\n\\nSo this customer email is in the context of some order, all of the CRM record gets completed in context and a reply gets generated with the CRM data. That's the type of stuff that's already happening. Then you take something like Copilot Studio, you can start even grounding it in more data and then completing workflows. So you could say if this email comes from this customer whose order date is got a particular issue with it, you can then go and escalate it to somebody else who gets a notification in Teams. And those are the kinds of workflows that are getting built within IT or by end users themselves.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:55:42\\n\\nWhat used to be line of business applications to us are Copilot extensions going forward. So we think of this as really a new design system for knowledge and frontline work to drive productivity, which will be very akin to what has happened in software engineering. So when you think about marketing or finance or sales or customer service, we will effectively replicate what you just said, which is the type of productivity we've seen in developers will come to all of these functions as they think about their work, workflow and work artifact, all being driven by co pilots.\\n\\nSpeaker 6\\n\\n00:56:22\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\n\\n00:56:23\\n\\nThanks, Mark. Operator, we have time for one last question.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n00:56:28\\n\\nAnd the last question will come from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\\n\\nSpeaker 8\\n\\n00:56:35\\n\\nHi, good evening and thank you for the opportunity to ask the question. I actually wanted to veer towards gaming, if I could for a second. Xbox content services revenue grew 61%, 58 points help from Activision. So net is about 3 points of growth. How should investors think about the longer term growth potential in this area?\\n\\nSpeaker 8\\n\\n00:56:58\\n\\nYou've made significant investments, including the Activision deal. But how should investors be thinking about the growth potential of the gaming area? What are the puts and takes to help make considerations here? Thank you.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:57:11\\n\\nYes. For us, our investment in gaming fundamentally was to have, I would say, the right portfolio of both what we love about gaming and always have loved about gaming, which is Xbox and the content for the console and expand from there so that we have content for everywhere people play games, starting with the PC. So when I think about the Activision portfolio, it comes with great assets for us to cover both the PC and the console. And then of course, assets to cover mobile sockets, which we never had. So we feel that now we have both the content and the ability to access all the traditional high scale platforms where people play games, which is the console, PC and mobile.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:58:02\\n\\nBut we're also excited about these new sockets. I mean, the fact that even in this last quarter, we expanded Xcloud to Amazon TV. I forget the name of what it's called. But that's the type of new access that really helps us a lot, get reach new gamers or the same gamer everywhere they want to play. And that ultimately will show up in that software plus services and transaction revenue for us, which is really our long term KPI.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:58:35\\n\\nAnd that's what we're building towards. And that was the strategy behind Activision as an asset. Amy, if you want to add to it.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n00:58:42\\n\\nNo, I do think the real goal here is to be able to take a broad set of content to more users in more places and really build what looks more like to us a software annuity and subscription business with enhanced transactions and the ownership of IP, which is quite valuable long term. As Hatya mentioned, things where with the ownership of IP, it can be monetized in multiple ways. And I think we're really encouraged by some of the progress and how we're making progress with Game Pass as well with some of the new announcements. Thank you, Keith.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\n\\n00:59:18\\n\\nThanks, Keith. That wraps up the Q and A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\n00:59:26\\n\\nThank you. Thank you all.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\nGreetings and welcome to the Microsoft Fiscal Year 20 24 4th Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Brett Iverson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\\n\\nGood afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Sati Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer and Heath Oliver, Corporate Secretary and Deputy General Counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non GAAP financial measures. More detailed outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft Investor Relations website when we provide outlook commentary on today's call. On this call, we will discuss certain non GAAP items.\\n\\nThe non GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's 4th quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only.\\n\\nWe'll post our prepared remarks to our Web site immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making forward looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events.\\n\\nThese statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10 ks, Forms 10 Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\\n\\nThank you, Brett. We had a solid close to our fiscal year. All up annual revenue was more than $245,000,000,000 up 15% year over year and Microsoft Cloud revenue surpassed $135,000,000,000 up 23%. Before I dive in, I want to offer some broader perspective on the AI platform shift. Similar to the cloud, this transition involves both knowledge and capital intensive investments.\\n\\nAnd as we go through this shift, we are focused on 2 fundamental things. First, driving innovation across a product portfolio that spans infrastructure and applications so as to ensure that we are maximizing our opportunity, while in parallel continuing to scale our cloud business and prioritizing fundamentals starting with security. 2nd, using customer demand signal and time to value to manage our cost structure dynamically and generate durable long term operating leverage. With that, let me highlight examples starting with Azure. Our share gains accelerated this year driven by AI.\\n\\nWe expanded our data center footprint announcing investments across 4 continents. These are long term assets around the world to drive growth for the next decade and beyond. We added new AI accelerators from AMD and NVIDIA as well as our own first party silicon Azure Maya and we introduced new Cobalt 100 which provides best in class performance for customers like Elastic, MongoDB, Siemens, Snowflake and Teradata. We continue to see sustained revenue growth from migrations. Azure Arc is helping customers in every industry from ABB and Cathay Pacific to La Liga to streamline their cloud migrations.\\n\\nWe now have 36,000 ARC customers up 90% year over year. We remain the hyperscale cloud of choice for SAP and Oracle workloads. Atos, Kohl's, Daimler Truck AG, Domino's, Halion, for example, all migrated their mission critical SAP workloads to our cloud. And with our Azure VMware solution, we offer the fastest and most cost effective way for customers to migrate their VMware workloads to. With Azure AI, we are building out the app server for the AI wave, providing access to the most diverse selection of models to meet customers' unique cost, latency and design considerations.\\n\\nAll up, we now have over 60,000 Azure AI customers up nearly 60% year over year and average spend per customer continues to grow. Azure OpenAI service provides access to best in class frontier models including as of this quarter GPT 4.0 and GPT 4.0 Mini. It's being used by leading companies in every industry, including H and R Block, Suzuki, Swiss Re, Telstra, as well as digital natives like Freshworks, Meesho and Zomato. With 5.3, we offer a family of powerful small language models which are being used by companies like BlackRock, Emirates, Epic, ITC, Navy Federal Credit Union and others. And with models as a service, we provide API access to 3rd party models including as of last week the latest from Cohere, Meta and Mistral.\\n\\nThe number of paid models as a service customers more than doubled quarter over quarter and we are seeing increased usage by leaders in every industry from Adobe and Bridgestone to Novo Nordisk and Palantir. Now on to data. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform provides customers with the broadest capabilities spanning databases, analytics, business intelligence and governance along with seamless integration with all of our AI services. The number of Azure AI customers also using our data and analytics tools grew nearly 50% year over year. Microsoft Fabric, our AI powered next generation data platform, now has over 14,000 paid customers, including leaders in every industry from Accenture and Kroger to Rockwell Automation and Zeiss, up 20% quarter over quarter.\\n\\nAnd this quarter, we introduced new first of their kind real time intelligence capabilities in fabrics, so customers can unlock insights on high volume time sensitive data. Now on to developer tools. GitHub Copilot is by far the most widely adopted AI powered developer tool. Just over 2 years since its general availability, more than 77,000 organizations from BBVA, FedEx and H and M to Infosys and Paytm have adopted CoPilot, up 180% year over year. And we're going further with CoPilot Workspace, we offer CoPilot native end to end developer productivity across plan, build, test, debug and deploy cycle.\\n\\nCoPilot is driving GitHub growth all up. GitHub annual revenue run rate is now $2,000,000,000 Copilot accounted for over 40% of GitHub revenue growth this year and is already a larger business than all of GitHub was when we acquired it. We are also integrating generative AI across Power Platform enabling anyone to use natural language to create apps, automate workflows or build a website. To date, over 480,000 organizations have used AI powered capabilities in Power Platform, up 45% quarter over quarter. In total, we now have 48,000,000 monthly active users of Power Platform, up 40% year over year.\\n\\nNow on to future of work. Co pilot for Microsoft 365 is becoming a daily habit for knowledge workers as it transforms work, workflow and work artifacts. The number of people who use Copilot daily at work nearly doubled quarter over quarter as they use it to complete tasks faster, hold more more effective meetings and automate business workflows and processes. CoPilot customers increased more than 60% quarter over quarter. Feedback has been positive with majority of enterprise customers coming back to purchase more seats.\\n\\nAll up, the number of customers with more than 10,000 seats more than doubled quarter over quarter, including Capital Group, Disney, Dow, Kendrel, Novartis and alone will deploy CoPilot to 150,000 of its employees. And we are going further adding agent capabilities to CoPilot. New team CoPilot can facilitate meetings and create and assign tasks. And with CoPilot Studio, customers can extend CoPilot for Microsoft 365 and build custom CoPilots that proactively respond to data and events using their own first and third party business data. To date, 50,000 organizations from Carnival Corporations, Cognizant and Eaton to KPMG, Majesco and McKinsey have used CoPilot Studio up over 70% quarter over quarter.\\n\\nWe're also extending CoPilot to specific industries including healthcare with DAX CoPilot more than 400 health care organizations, including Community Health Network, Intermountain, Northwestern Memorial Healthcare and Ohio State University, Wexner Medical Center have purchased Dax CoPilot to date, up 40% quarter over quarter and the number of AI generated clinical reports more than tripled. Copilot is also transforming ERP and CRM business applications. We again took share this quarter as customers like Thermo Fisher Scientific switched to Dynamics. Our new Dynamics 365 Contact Center is a Copilot First solution that infuses generative AI throughout the contact center workflow. Companies like 1-eight 100 Flowers, Mediterranean Shipping, Synoptec will rely on it to deliver better customer support.\\n\\nAnd Dynamics 365 Business Central is now trusted by over 40,000 organizations for core ERP. Microsoft Teams has become essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate and do business. We once again saw year over year usage growth. Teams Premium has surpassed 3,000,000 seats, up nearly 400 percent year over year as organizations like Dentsu, Eli Lilly and Ford chose it for advanced features like end to end encryption and real time translation. When it comes to devices, we introduced our new category of CoPilot Plus PCs this quarter.\\n\\nThey are the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever. They include a new system architecture designed to deliver best in class performance and breakthrough AI experiences. We are delighted by early reviews and we are looking forward to the introduction of more CoPilot Plus PCs powered by all of our silicon and OEM partners in the coming months. More broadly, Windows 11 active devices increased 50% year over year and we are seeing accelerated adoption of Windows 11 by companies like Carlsberg, E. ON, National Australia Bank.\\n\\nAnd now on to security. We continue to prioritize security above all else. We are doubling down on our Secure Future initiative as we implement our principles of secure by design, secure by default and secure operations. Through this initiative, we are also continually applying what we are learning and translating it into innovation for our customers, including how we approach AI. Over 1,000 paid customers used CoPilot for security, including Alaska Airlines, Oregon State University, Petrofac, Wipro, WTW and we are also securing customers' AI deployments with updates to Defender and Purview.\\n\\nAll up, we now have 1,200,000 secondurity customers over 800,000 including Dell Technologies, Deutsche Telekom, TomTom used 4 or more workloads, up 25% year over year. And Defender for Cloud, solution surpassed $1,000,000,000 in revenue over the past 12 months as we protect customer workloads across multi cloud and hybrid environments. Now let me turn to our consumer businesses starting with LinkedIn. LinkedIn continues to see accelerated member growth and record engagement. 1,500,000 pieces of content are shared every minute on the platform and video is now the fastest growing format on LinkedIn with uploads up 34% year over year.\\n\\nLinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message to the right audience on a safe trusted platform. And when it comes to our subscription businesses, premium sign ups increased 51% this fiscal year and we are adding even more value to our members and customers with new AI AI tools. Our reimagined AI powered LinkedIn premium experience is now available for every premium subscriber worldwide, And now on to search, advertising and news. We are in And now on to search, advertising and news. We are ensuring that Bing, Edge and CoPilot collectively TAC increased 19% year over year and we again TAC increased 19% year over year and we again took share across Bing and Edge.\\n\\nWe continue to apply generative AI to pioneer new approaches to how people search and browse. Just last week, we announced we are testing a new generative search experience, which creates a dynamic response to users' query while maintaining click share to publishers. And we continue to drive record engagement with Copilot for the web. Consumers have used Copilot to create over 12,000,000,000 images and conduct 13,000,000,000 chats to date, up 150% since the start of the calendar year. Thousands of news and entertainment publishers trust us to reach new audiences with Microsoft Start, and in fact, we have paid them $1,000,000,000 over the last 5 years.\\n\\nWe are helping advertisers increase their ROI too. We have seen positive ad platform helps marketeers create campaigns and troubleshoot using natural language. Now on to gaming. We now have over 500,000,000 monthly active users across platforms and devices and our content pipeline has never been stronger. We previewed a record 30 new titles at our showcase this quarter, 18 of them such as Call of Duty, Black Ops 6 will be available on Game Pass.\\n\\nGame Pass Ultimate subscribers can now stream games directly on devices they already have including as of last month Amazon Fire TVs. Finally, we are bringing our IP to new audiences. Fallout, for example, made its debut as a TV show on Amazon Prime this quarter. It was the 2nd most watched title on the platform ever and hours played on Game Pass for the Fallout franchise increased nearly 5x quarter over quarter. In closing, I'm energized about the opportunities ahead.\\n\\nWe are investing for the long term in our fundamentals, in our innovation and in our people. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.\\n\\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $64,700,000,000 up 15% 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.95 and increased 10% 11% in constant currency. In our largest quarter of the year, we again delivered double digit top and bottom line growth with continued share gains across many of our businesses and record commitments to our Microsoft Cloud Platform. Commercial bookings were significantly ahead of expectations and increased 17% and 19% in constant currency.\\n\\nThis record commitment quarter was driven by growth in the number $10,000,000 plus $100,000,000 plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365 and consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 20% 21% in constant currency to $269,000,000,000 Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 18% year over year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 21%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 97%. At a company level, Activision contributed net impact of approximately 3 points to revenue growth, was a 2 point drag on operating income growth and had a negative $0.06 impact to earnings per share.\\n\\nA reminder that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from prior relationship as a 3rd party partner to 1st party and includes $938,000,000 from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction related costs. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $36,800,000,000 and grew 21% 22% in constant currency, roughly in line with expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points year over year to 69%, in line with expectations. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by improvement in Azure even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure.\\n\\nCompany gross margin dollars increased 14% 15% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year over year to 70%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly even with the impact from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction related costs from the Activision acquisition. Operating expenses increased 13% with 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, headcount at the end of June was 3% higher than a year ago. Operating income increased 15% and 16% in constant currency and operating margins were 43%, relatively unchanged year over year.\\n\\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased slightly driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier and improved operating leverage through continued cost discipline. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $20,300,000,000 and grew 11% and 12% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations, driven by better than expected results across all business units. Office Commercial revenue grew 12% 13% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 13% 14% in constant currency with ARPU growth primarily from E5 momentum as well as CoPilot for Microsoft 365.\\n\\nPaid Office 365 commercial seats grew 7% year over year with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although both segments continued to moderate. Office Commercial Licensing declined 9% and 7% in constant currency with continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office Consumer revenue increased 3% 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 Subscriptions, which grew 10% to $82,500,000 LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, driven by better than expected performance across all businesses. Dynamics revenue grew 16%, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 19% 20% in constant currency.\\n\\nWe saw continued growth across all workloads and better than expected new business. Dynamics 365 now represents roughly 90% of total Dynamics revenue. Segment gross margin dollars increased 9% and in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year over year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by Office 365 as we scale our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 5% and operating income increased 12% 13% in constant currency.\\n\\nNext, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $28,500,000,000 increasing 19% 20% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue grew 21% 22% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud Services revenue grew 29% 30% in constant currency, in line with expectations and consistent with Q3 when adjusting for leap year. Azure growth included 8 points from AI Services where demand remained higher than our available capacity.\\n\\nIn June, we saw slightly lower than expected growth in a few European geos. In our per user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 10% to over 281,000,000 seats with continued impact from moderated growth in seats sold outside the Microsoft 365 Suite. Therefore, our Azure consumption business continues to grow faster than total Azure. In our on premises server business, revenue increased 2% 3% in constant currency. Growth was driven by demand for our hybrid solutions, although with slightly lower than expected transactional purchasing.\\n\\nEnterprise and Partner Services revenue decreased 7% on a strong prior year comparable for Enterprise Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points year over year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by the improvement in Azure noted earlier even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 5% and operating income grew 22% and 23% in constant currency. Now to more personal computing.\\n\\nRevenue was $15,900,000,000 increasing 14% 15% in constant currency with 12 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations driven by Windows Commercial and Search. The PC market was as expected and Windows OEM revenue increased 4% year over year. Windows Commercial Products and Cloud Services revenue increased 11% 12% in constant currency ahead of expectations due to higher end period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. Devices revenue decreased 11% 9% in constant currency, roughly in line with expectations as we remain focused on our higher margin premium products.\\n\\nWhile early days, we're excited about the recent launch of our CoPilot Plus PCs. Search and News advertising revenue ex TAC increased 19% ahead of expectations, primarily due to improved execution. Healthy volume growth was driven by Bing and Edge. And in Gaming, revenue increased 44% with 48 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61% slightly ahead of expectations with 58 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\\n\\nStronger than expected performance in 1st party content was partially offset by 3rd party content performance. Xbox hardware revenue decreased 42% 41% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 21% with 10 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points year over year, primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 43% with 41 points from the Activision acquisition.\\n\\nOperating income increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $19,000,000,000 in line with expectations and cash paid for PP and E was $13,900,000,000 Cloud and AI related spend represents nearly all of our total capital expenditures. Within that, roughly half is for infrastructure needs where we continue to build and lease data centers that will support monetization over the next 15 years beyond. The remaining cloud and AI related spend is primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs to serve customers based on demand signals.\\n\\nFor the full fiscal year, the mix of our cloud and AI related spend was similar to Q4. Cash flow from operations was $37,200,000,000 up 29 percent driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $23,300,000,000 up 18% year over year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings. For the full year, cash flow from operations surpassed $100,000,000,000 for the first time, reaching $119,000,000,000 This quarter, other income expense was negative $675,000,000 more favorable than anticipated with lower than expected interest expense and higher than expected interest income. Our losses on investments accounted for under the equity method were as expected.\\n\\nOur effective tax rate was approximately 19%, higher than anticipated due to a state tax law signed in June that was effective retroactively. And finally, we returned $8,400,000,000 to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, bringing our total cash return to shareholders to over $34,000,000,000 for the full fiscal year. Now moving to our outlook. My commentary for both the full year and next quarter is on a U. S.\\n\\nDollar basis unless specifically noted otherwise. Let me start with some full year commentary for FY 2025. First, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to have no meaningful impact to full year revenue, COGS or operating expense growth. Next, we continue to expect double digit revenue and operating income growth as we focus on delivering differentiated value for our customers.\\n\\nTo meet the growing demand signal for our AI and cloud products, we will scale our infrastructure investments with FY 2025 capital expenditures expected to be higher than FY 2024. As a reminder, these expenditures are dependent on demand signals and adoption of our services that will be managed through the year. As scaling these investments drives growth in COGS, we will remain disciplined on operating expense management. Therefore, we expect FY 'twenty five OpEx growth to be in the single digits. And given our focused commitment to managing at the operating margin level, we still expect FY 2025 operating margins to be down only about 1 point year over year.\\n\\nAnd finally, we expect our FY 2025 effective tax rate to be around 19%. Now to the outlook for our Q1. Based on current rates, we expect FX to decrease total revenue and segment level revenue growth by less than 1 point. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by less than one point and to have no meaningful impact to operating expense growth. In Commercial Bookings, increased long term commitments to our platform and strong execution across core annuity sales motions should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base.\\n\\nAs a reminder, larger long term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 70%, down year over year, driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. We expect capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis given our cloud and AI demand as well as existing AI capacity constraints. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next is segment guidance.\\n\\nIn Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 10% 11% in constant currency or US20.3 billion dollars to US20.6 billion dollars In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5 and Copilot for Microsoft 365. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency. In our on premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high teens. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 Subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits, driven by continued growth across all businesses.\\n\\nAnd in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 18% 20% in constant currency or $28,600,000,000 to $28,900,000,000 Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which as a reminder can have quarterly variability primarily from our per user business and in period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth to be 28% to 29% in constant currency. Growth will continue to be driven by our consumption business inclusive of AI, which is growing faster than total Azure. We expect the consumption trends from Q4 to continue through the first half of the year.\\n\\nThis includes both AI demand impacted by capacity constraints and non AI growth trends similar to June. Growth in our per user business will continue to moderate. And in H2, we expect Azure growth to accelerate as our capital investments create an increase in available AI capacity to serve more of the growing demand. In our on premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low single digits as continued hybrid demand will be more than offset by lower transactional purchasing. And in Enterprise and Partner Services, revenue should decline in the low single digits.\\n\\nIn More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 9% 12% constant currency or $14,900,000,000 to $15,300,000,000 Windows OEM revenue growth should be relatively flat, roughly in line with the PC market. In Windows Commercial Products and Cloud Services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our Advanced Security Solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In devices revenue growth should be in the low to mid single digits. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the mid to high teens.\\n\\nThis will be higher than overall Search and News Advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be in the low single digits. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid-30s, including approximately 40 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low to mid-50s driven by the net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will again decline year over year. Now back to company guidance.\\n\\nWe expect COGS between US19.95 billion dollars to US20.15 billion dollars including approximately $700,000,000 from purchase accounting, integration and transaction related costs from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expense of 15 point $2,000,000,000 to $15,300,000,000 including approximately $200,000,000 from purchase accounting, integration and transaction related costs from the Activision acquisition. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $650,000,000 driven by losses on investments accounted for under the equity method as interest income will be mostly offset by interest expense. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.\\n\\nIn closing, we remain focused on delivering innovations that matter to our global customers of every size. That focus extends to delivering on our financial commitments as well. We delivered operating margin growth of nearly 3 points year over year, even as we accelerate our AI investments, completed the Activision acquisition and had a headwind from the change in useful lives last year. So as we begin FY 'twenty five, we will continue to invest in the cloud and AI opportunity ahead, aligned and if needed, adjusted to the demand signals we see. We are committed to growing our leadership across our commercial cloud and within that the AI platform, And we feel well positioned as we start FY 'twenty five.\\n\\nWith that, let's go to Q and A, Brett.\\n\\nThanks, Davey. We'll now move over to Q and A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\\n\\nAnd our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\\n\\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on another great quarter and really solid overall fiscal year. Right now, there's a industry debate raging around the CapEx requirements around generative AI and whether the monetization is actually going to match with that. And I think the question for you guys from a Microsoft perspective is CapEx still an appropriate leading indicator for cloud growth or do the shifting gross margin profiles change that equation? Or said another way, maybe can you give us a little bit more help in understanding the timing between the CapEx investments and the yields on those investments?\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nThank you, Keith. Let me start and then Amy can add to this. I think I would say we primarily start right now from the demand side. What I mean by that is, what's the product shape of the product portfolio, what we learned even from the cloud transition, which as you know, Keith was similar in the sense it was both a knowledge intensive and capital intensive transition. We needed to have the product portfolio where there was the right mix of, I'll call it, infrastructure, meters as well as SaaS applications.\\n\\nSo that's the first thing that we are looking at. And how is that value landing M365 Copilot as perhaps the best Office 365 or M365 Suite we have had. The fact that we're getting recurring customers, so customers coming back, buying more seats. So GitHub Copilot now being bigger than even GitHub when we bought it, what's happening in the contact center with Dynamics. So I would say and obviously the Azure AI growth, that's the first place we look at.\\n\\nThat then drives bulk of the CapEx spend. Basically, that's the demand signal, Because you got to remember, even in the capital spend, there is land and there is data center build, but 60% plus is the kit. That only will be bought for inferencing and everything else if there is demand signal, right. So that's I think the key way to think about capital cycle even. The asset, as Amy said, is a long term asset, which is land and the data center, which by the way, we don't even construct things fully.\\n\\nWe can even have things which are semi constructed, we call coal shells and so on. So we know how to manage our CapEx spend to build out a long term asset. And a lot of the hydration of the kid happens when we have the demand signal. There is definitely spend for training. Even there, of course, we will only be scaling training as we see the demand accrue in any given period in time.\\n\\nSo I would say it's more important to manage to capture the opportunity with the right product portfolio that's driving value. And on that front, I feel good about the breadth of Microsoft offering, whether it's in consumer side, whether it's in commercial per seat side or on the consumption meters, that's I think the fundamental driver.\\n\\nAnd Keith, I do think and I really do appreciate how you phrased the question as well because I think the timing and some of the questions you all have had really led to how we were talking even about capital expense in our comments and in my comments today. Being able to maybe share a little more about that, when we talked about roughly half of FY 2020 four's total capital expense as well as half of Q4's expense, it's really on land and build and finance leases. And those things really will be monetized over 15 years and beyond. And they're incredibly flexible, because we've built a consistent architecture, 1st with the commercial cloud and second with the Azure Stack for AI, regardless of whether demand is at the platform layer or at the app layer or through 3rd parties and partners or frankly, our first party SaaS, it uses the same infrastructure. So, it's got long lived flexible assets.\\n\\nAnd if you think about it that way, you can see what we're doing and focused on is building out this network in parallel across the globe, because when we did this last transition, the first transition to the cloud, which seems a long time ago sometimes, it rolled out quite differently. We rolled out more geo by geo. And this one, because we have demand on a global basis, we are doing it on a global basis, which is important. We have large customers in every geo. And so hopefully with that sort of shape of our capital expense, it helps people see how much of that is sort of near term monetization driver as well as a much longer duration.\\n\\nThat's super helpful. Thank you very much.\\n\\nThanks, Keith. Operator, next question please.\\n\\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\\n\\nThank you very much. Thank you for taking the question and congrats on\\n\\na strong year. GenAI has been a bit of\\n\\na roller coaster with tech over the last year with periods of acceleration, high expectations and the expectations drop as reality kicked in. With Azure growth we've seen this quarter and O365 commercial not yet fully visible in numbers even though Amy you gave us a lot of color on it. Two quick parts to the question. Satya, how should we think about what it's going to take for GenAI to become more real across the industry and for it to become more visible within your SaaS offerings? And Amy, with cloud, it took time for margins to improve.\\n\\nIt looks like with AI, it's happening quicker.\\n\\nCan you give us a sense\\n\\nof how you think about the margin impact near term and long term from all the investment on AI? Thank you.\\n\\nYes. Thanks again, Mark for the question. So to me, look at the end of the day, Gen AI is just software. So it is really translating into fundamentally growth on what has been our M365 SaaS offering with a new offering that is the co pilot SaaS offering, which today is on a growth rate that's faster than any other previous generation of software we launched as a suite in M365. That's I think the best way to describe it.\\n\\nI mean, the numbers I think we shared even this quarter are indicative of this, Mark. So if you look at it, we have both the landing of the seats itself quarter over quarter that is growing 60%, right. That's a pretty good healthy sign. The most healthy sign for me is the fact that customers are coming back there. That is the same customers with whom we landed the seats coming back and buying more seats.\\n\\nAnd then the number of customers with 10,000 plus seats doubled, right, it's 2x quarter over quarter. That to me is a healthy SaaS core business. And on top of that, some of the things that Amy shared are on dynamic. That's another exciting place for us, which is, 1, we're gaining share. We're dynamics with the Gen AI built in is sort of really biz apps is probably the category that gets completely transformed with Gen AI.\\n\\nContact centers being a great example. We ourselves are on course to save 100 of 1,000,000 of dollars in our own customer support and contact center operations. So I think we can drive that value to our customers. And then on the Azure side, you see the numbers very clearly. In fact, I think last quarter is when we started giving you that you saw an acceleration of that this quarter.\\n\\nOne of the other pieces, Mark, is AI doesn't sit on its own, right? So it's just we have a concept of design wins in Azure. So in fact, 50% of the folks who are using Azure AI are also using a data meter. That's very exciting to us because the most important thing in Azure is to win workloads in the enterprise. And that is starting to happen.\\n\\nAnd these are generational things once they get going with you. So that's I think how we think about it at least when I look at what's happening on our demand side.\\n\\nAnd Mark, to answer the second half of your question on margin improvement looking different than it did through the last cloud cycle, That's primarily for a reason I've mentioned a couple of times. We have a consistent platform. So because we're building to 1 Azure AI stack, we don't have to have multiple infrastructure investments. We're making 1. We're using that internally first party and that's what we're using with customers to build on as well as ISVs.\\n\\nSo it does in fact make margins start off better and obviously scale consistently.\\n\\nThe next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\\n\\nHi, thank you very much and congrats on a great fiscal year ending. Question for you, Amy, when you look at the CapEx, how do you bring efficiencies out of the CapEx you've disclosed at 50% of that was infrastructure, the other 50% tech is very useful. So in other words, do you have to keep growing CapEx at these elevated rates? Or could you slow down CapEx and still get that consistent revenue growth rate in your Azure and generative AI? That's the main question on my mind.\\n\\nThank you so much.\\n\\nThanks, Kash. That's a very good question. There's really 2 pieces, I think, as I heard your question that I would reflect on. The first is, could we see sort of consistent revenue growth without maybe what you would say is more of this sort of elevated capital expense number or something that continues to accelerate? And the answer to that is yes, because there's 2 different pieces, right?\\n\\nYou're seeing half of this go toward long term builds that Satya mentioned. The pace at which we fill those builds with CPUs or GPUs will be demand driven. And so if we see differences in demand signal, we can throttle that investment on the CPU side, which we've done for, I guess, a long time at this point, as I reflect. And we'll use all that same learning and demand signal understand to do the same thing on the GPU side. And so you're right that you could see relatively consistent revenue patterns and yet see these inconsistencies and capital spend quarter to quarter.\\n\\nThe other thing I would note, Kash, is you'll also notice there's a growing distinction between our CapEx number and on occasion the cash that we pay for PP and E. And you're going to start to see that more often in this period, because it happens when we use leases. Leases sort of show up all at once. And so you'll see a little bit more volatility. I've mentioned that in my comments before, but I mentioned again just because you're starting to see that distinction in my comments and hopefully that's helpful context.\\n\\nJust one other thing Amy if I wanted to add. I think as people think about capital spend, I think it's important to separate out leases from build. And when it comes to build, I think it's important for us to think about we think about it in terms of what's the total percentage of cost that goes into each line item, land, which obviously has a very different duration and a very different lead time. So those are the other two considerations. We think about lead time and duration of the asset, land, network, construction, the system or the kit, and then the ongoing cost.\\n\\nAnd so if you think about it that way, then you know how to even adjust, if you will, the capital spend based on demand signal.\\n\\nThank you. It was triggered by the jump in CapEx. And as Emmy pointed out, you're guiding to accelerating Azure revenue growth rate, which I guess follows the CapEx search. Thank you so much once again.\\n\\nThanks, Kash. Operator, next question please.\\n\\nThe next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\\n\\nThanks. Amy, the magnitude of beat this quarter was a little lower than we've seen in the past. Was there anything unusual on the sales cycle, the close rate that you saw? Thanks.\\n\\nThanks, Brent. Actually, no. As I was talking on the corner, I mean, commercial bookings were much better than we expected going into the quarter. Commitments were very good, execution across both the core sort of annuity renewal motion was good as expected. The larger long term commitments were better than we expected.\\n\\nSo, Britt, I would not say there was anything really unusual in how I thought about and what we saw in our commercial execution through the quarter.\\n\\nGreat. Thank you.\\n\\nThanks, Brent. Operator, next question please.\\n\\nThe next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.\\n\\nOkay, great. So maybe I'll direct this to Amy. Amy, I know when you set your Azure guidance, you're always looking to meet or beat the high end. The 30% you put up in the June quarter, amazing number given the scale of Azure, but it did come in at the low end of your range. And I'd just love for you to maybe elaborate on the delta.\\n\\nI guess as I reflect on what you've said in your comments, there's 2 things that I heard you say. 1, it sounded like there's persistent capacity constraints that you think might get alleviated in the second half. And then secondly, you mentioned perhaps some modest softness in Europe. I presume that's a little bit more economic rather than Azure specific. Is that the right way to frame the performance in the quarter?\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nThanks, Carl. Yes, that's exactly right. Maybe I'll just repeat it just so people can hear it in my words as well. To that 30% to 31% guide for Q4 and coming in at the lower end of 30. You're exactly right.\\n\\nThe distinguishing between being at the higher end or at the lower end really was some softness we saw in a few European geos on non AI consumption really made the difference in that number. And we've assumed that going forward into H1, inclusive of my guided 28% to 29% going forward. And then let me separate, which was your larger point, which is one of the other factors you see ongoing. Number 1, you're right, capacity constraints, particularly on AI and Azure will remained in Q4 and will remain in H1. So hopefully, that's helpful.\\n\\nYes. Thank you, Amy.\\n\\nThanks, Carl. Operator, next question please.\\n\\nThe next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\\n\\nGreat. Thank you very much. Amy, with Azure demand once again greater than available capacity, I appreciate the CapEx investments and the build out and acceleration you expect in the back half. But as we think about cloud capacity and AI services specifically, can you talk about both the near term and long term strategy around the AI partnerships that you're signing with the likes of Oracle and CorWee, for example? Thank you.\\n\\nThanks, Brad. Maybe separate a couple of things. We are and we've talked about it now for quite a few quarters. We are constrained on AI capacity. And because of that, actually we've to your point, have signed up with 3rd parties to help us as we are behind with some leases on AI capacity.\\n\\nWe've done that with partners who are happy to help us extend the Azure platform to be able to serve this Azure AI demand. And you do see us investing quite a bit, as we've talked about in builds, so that we can get back in a more balanced place.\\n\\nYes, I mean to me it's no different than leases that we would have done in the past. These you would even say sometimes buying from Oracle maybe even more efficient leases because they're even shorter\\n\\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\\n\\nThank you very much. With a couple of quarters of co pilot for M365 availability under your belt now, How are you assessing the capability of CoPilot to replicate the productivity gains that they've created for developers, which seem to be very high, and to do something similar for the broader population of knowledge workers? For instance, you're mentioning the 10,000 seat deals, the repeat purchases. Is it possible to eventually see Copilot penetration rates equally high in office as they will be in GitHub?\\n\\nYes, that's a great question. In fact, the GitHub design system create a plan, from a plan you create a spec or you create a spec and from a spec you create a plan and then you go operate across the full repo. That's effectively the design system that is getting replicated inside of even the M365 Copilot. And you see this even now. For example, you get an email, you're in sales, you want to respond to the customer, the data from the email is essentially context for a prompt, but you expand by bringing in all of your CRM data, right.\\n\\nSo this customer email is in the context of some order, all of the CRM record gets completed in context and a reply gets generated with the CRM data. That's the type of stuff that's already happening. Then you take something like Copilot Studio, you can start even grounding it in more data and then completing workflows. So you could say if this email comes from this customer whose order date is got a particular issue with it, you can then go and escalate it to somebody else who gets a notification in Teams. And those are the kinds of workflows that are getting built within IT or by end users themselves.\\n\\nWhat used to be line of business applications to us are Copilot extensions going forward. So we think of this as really a new design system for knowledge and frontline work to drive productivity, which will be very akin to what has happened in software engineering. So when you think about marketing or finance or sales or customer service, we will effectively replicate what you just said, which is the type of productivity we've seen in developers will come to all of these functions as they think about their work, workflow and work artifact, all being driven by co pilots.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nThanks, Mark. Operator, we have time for one last question.\\n\\nAnd the last question will come from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\\n\\nHi, good evening and thank you for the opportunity to ask the question. I actually wanted to veer towards gaming, if I could for a second. Xbox content services revenue grew 61%, 58 points help from Activision. So net is about 3 points of growth. How should investors think about the longer term growth potential in this area?\\n\\nYou've made significant investments, including the Activision deal. But how should investors be thinking about the growth potential of the gaming area? What are the puts and takes to help make considerations here? Thank you.\\n\\nYes. For us, our investment in gaming fundamentally was to have, I would say, the right portfolio of both what we love about gaming and always have loved about gaming, which is Xbox and the content for the console and expand from there so that we have content for everywhere people play games, starting with the PC. So when I think about the Activision portfolio, it comes with great assets for us to cover both the PC and the console. And then of course, assets to cover mobile sockets, which we never had. So we feel that now we have both the content and the ability to access all the traditional high scale platforms where people play games, which is the console, PC and mobile.\\n\\nBut we're also excited about these new sockets. I mean, the fact that even in this last quarter, we expanded Xcloud to Amazon TV. I forget the name of what it's called. But that's the type of new access that really helps us a lot, get reach new gamers or the same gamer everywhere they want to play. And that ultimately will show up in that software plus services and transaction revenue for us, which is really our long term KPI.\\n\\nAnd that's what we're building towards. And that was the strategy behind Activision as an asset. Amy, if you want to add to it.\\n\\nNo, I do think the real goal here is to be able to take a broad set of content to more users in more places and really build what looks more like to us a software annuity and subscription business with enhanced transactions and the ownership of IP, which is quite valuable long term. As Hatya mentioned, things where with the ownership of IP, it can be monetized in multiple ways. And I think we're really encouraged by some of the progress and how we're making progress with Game Pass as well with some of the new announcements. Thank you, Keith.\\n\\nThanks, Keith. That wraps up the Q and A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\\n\\nThank you. Thank you all.\\n\\n![Quartr](/images/quartr-logotype-svg.svg)\\n\\n#### Key Takeaways\\n\\n#### Conference Call Audio\\n\\n## Earnings Documents\\n\\n![Microsoft's Q4 2024 Slide Deck](https://cdn.quartr.com/images/conference-calls/microsoft-corporation-q4-2024-28901620ddb402d1/1.png?ref=bWFya2V0YmVhdA==)Slide Deck\\n![Microsoft's Q4 2024 Press Release](https://cdn.quartr.com/images/reports/microsoft-corporation-q4-2024-bace3f2d6adca591/1.png?ref=bWFya2V0YmVhdA==)Press Release  \\n(8-K)\\n![Microsoft's Q4 2024 Annual report](https://cdn.quartr.com/images/reports/microsoft-corporation-annual-report-2024-a985dc0e3b33af7b/1.png?ref=bWFya2V0YmVhdA==)\\n\\n## Microsoft Earnings Headlines\\n\\n![Earnings Season Winners](https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/articles/thumb_20250507153633_5-stocks-that-crushed-earnings-and-guidance-foreca.png)\\n![Prague, Czechia - 02 21 2025: Laptop on surface showing Broadcom logo. — Stock Editorial Photography](https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/articles/thumb_20250506160032_broadcom-stock-gets-a-lift-on-hyperscaler-earnings.jpg)\\n![](https://3328.efuserassets.com/3328/offers/50/c/379/assets/Image9-edit.jpg)\\n![](https://www.marketbeat.com/scripts/TriggeredCampaignPixel.ashx?TriggeredCampaignID=13121&Placement=NativeDisplay&Source=NativeDisplay)\\n![Meta Takes A Bow With Q1 Earnings - Watch For Tariff Impact in Q2](https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/articles/thumb_20250502092659_meta-takes-a-bow-with-q1-earnings---watch-for-tari.jpg)\\n![](/images/news-sites/pymnts.jpg)\\n![](/images/news-sites/reuters.jpg)\\n\\nWant to stay updated on the latest earnings announcements and upcoming reports for companies like Microsoft?

The company quickly took off and was relocated to Washington State where it is headquartered today.\\n\\nMicrosoft launched a game called Flight Simulator in 1982 that has since become the longest-running video game franchise. The company’s first major breakthrough came in the early 80s when it licensed MS-DOS to IBM for their personal computer and then another came in 1985 the company altered the way computers were used when it launched Windows. Windows used a graphical interface to display information that included drop-down menus, scroll bars, and other features commonly found in operating systems today.\\n\\nMicrosoft went public in 1986 making founder Bill Gates the world’s youngest billionaire. Other innovations that helped make the company’s name include Windows 95 which included many upgrades to the original and, when the Internet took off, Internet Explorer. Bill Gates gave up his role as CEO in 2000 and the company is now run by Satya Nadella.

The company operates in three segments that include Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. As of 2022, Microsoft’s Azure powered more than 20% of the Cloud putting it in second place globally.\\n\\nThe Productivity and Business Processes segment offers several software solutions including Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Office 365 Security and Compliance, Microsoft Viva, and Skype for Business. Microsoft also operates Skype, Outlook.com, OneDrive, and LinkedIn for business professionals as well as Dynamics 365. Dynamics 365 is a set of cloud-based and on-premises business solutions for organizations and enterprises of all sizes.\\n\\nThe Intelligent Cloud segment licenses SQL, Windows Servers, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses. Microsoft Intelligent Cloud also operates GitHub which is a collaboration platform and code hosting service for developers. Intelligent Cloud also hosts Nuance healthcare and enterprise AI solutions, and Azure, a cloud platform, as well as associated services.\\n\\nThe More Personal Computing segment provides Windows original equipment manufacturer (OEM) licensing and other licensing of the Windows family of operating systems. This includes Windows Commercial, Windows cloud services, and Windows Internet of Things.\\n\\nThe More Personal Computing segment also offers Surface, PC accessories, PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, Xbox hardware, and Xbox content and services including video games and third-party video game royalties.

Right now, there's a industry debate raging around the CapEx requirements around generative AI and whether the monetization is actually going to match with that. And I think the question for you guys from a Microsoft perspective is CapEx still an appropriate leading indicator for cloud growth or do the shifting gross margin profiles change that equation? Or said another way, maybe can you give us a little bit more help in understanding the timing between the CapEx investments and the yields on those investments?\n",

So GitHub Copilot now being bigger than even GitHub when we bought it, what's happening in the contact center with Dynamics.

That only will be bought for inferencing and everything else if there is demand signal, right. So that's I think the key way to think about capital cycle even.

Being able to maybe share a little more about that, when we talked about roughly half of FY 2020 four's total capital expense as well as half of Q4's expense, it's really on land and build and finance leases. And those things really will be monetized over 15 years and beyond. And they're incredibly flexible, because we've built a consistent architecture, 1st with the commercial cloud and second with the Azure Stack for AI, regardless of whether demand is at the platform layer or at the app layer or through 3rd parties and partners or frankly, our first party SaaS, it uses the same infrastructure.

We rolled out more geo by geo. And this one, because we have demand on a global basis, we are doing it on a global basis, which is important. We have large customers in every geo.

So when I think about the Activision portfolio, it comes with great assets for us to cover both the PC and the console. And then of course, assets to cover mobile sockets, which we never had.

It can process and generate text, images, and audio, enabling seamless human-computer interaction across various modalities.

These intelligent agent solutions move beyond simple rule-based automations by using reasoning engines, memory, and digital tools to navigate unpredictable environments and make decisions on the go. They represent a big step ahead in AI capabilities: from a passive tool to an active, capable digital workforce member.\\n\\n### Key Takeaways\\n\\n* Agentic AI moves beyond simple task automation to achieve complex business goals autonomously.\\n* Current agentic AI applications already automate entire workflows in sales, marketing, and finance, delivering significant ROI.\\n* Future multi-agent systems will create collaborative “digital workforces,” fundamentally reshaping industries and competitive landscapes.\\n* Successful autonomous AI implementation requires a phased strategy that builds from supervised augmentation to strategic autonomy.\\n* Deploying agentic AI introduces critical governance and security risks, such as “agent drift” and new attack surfaces, that demand robust oversight.\\n\\n## What is Agentic AI and Why 2025 is deemed to be “the year of the agents”?\\n\\nAI agents applications are diverse and they are not just an incremental improvement; The global market for **agentic AI applications** is projected to soar from $7.4 billion in 2025 to over $171.2 billion by 2034, driven by the immense productivity gains. [McKinsey estimates](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier) that generative AI use cases, which form the core of agentic reasoning, could add up to $4.4 trillion in annual value to the global economy. This economic impact stems from agentic AI’s unique ability to take on entire job functions, fundamentally changing how businesses operate and compete.\\n\\n### How agentic AI differs from automation and generative AI?\\n\\nAgentic AI differs from other AI technologies by its capacity for goal-oriented autonomy. While automation follows rigid scripts and generative AI creates content, agentic AI leverages both to reason, plan, and act in the real world to achieve a specific outcome.\\n\\n|  |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Feature | Traditional Automation | Generative AI | Agentic AI |\\n| **Primary Function** | **Execute**\\xa0predefined tasks | **Create**\\xa0new content | **Achieve**\\xa0a specific goal |\\n| **Core Capability** | Follows a rigid set of instructions and pre-set rules. | Recognizes patterns in data to generate plausible text, images, or code. | Reasons, plans, and acts autonomously by using tools and adapting to new information. |\\n| **Adaptability** | **Low.**\\xa0It struggles with situations outside of its pre-programmed parameters. | **Medium.**\\xa0It adapts its output based on the user’s prompt and conversational context. | **High.**\\xa0It can learn from its environment and dynamically alter its plan to overcome obstacles. |\\n| **Decision-Making** | **None.**\\xa0It executes pre-defined actions without understanding the situation. | **Probabilistic.**\\xa0It generates the most likely next word or pixel, not a strategic choice. | **Strategic.**\\xa0It makes autonomous choices to best achieve its overall objective. |\\n| **Simple Example** | A chatbot that answers FAQs based on a fixed script. | ChatGPT writing a marketing email based on a detailed prompt. | An AI agent managing a supply chain, autonomously rerouting shipments based on real-time weather and traffic data. |\\n\\n* **From “Executing a Script” to “Achieving an Outcome”:** A traditional automation script might be programmed to send 100 pre-written emails. In contrast, an AI agent given the goal “book five sales meetings” will autonomously research targets, decide on the optimal outreach strategy, draft personalized emails using its generative capabilities, manage follow-ups, and schedule the resulting meetings.\\n* **From “Generating Content” to “Using Content to Reason and Act”:** A generative AI tool like ChatGPT can write a marketing blog post. An agentic system orchestrates the entire process: it first analyzes market data to identify a high-value topic, uses a generative model to draft the post, accesses a tool like Grammarly for editing, and finally publishes the article to the company’s CMS and promotes it on social media.\\n* **Core Differentiators:** The key components that enable these advanced **agentic AI applications** include **autonomous goal-seeking** (operating independently toward an objective), **dynamic planning** (the ability to create and alter plans based on new information), and **environmental interaction** through the use of software tools and APIs.\\n\\n### What Are the Most Valuable Agentic AI Applications Driving ROI Today?\\n\\n[Intelligent agent solutions](https://techpilot.ai/agentic-workflows-guide-key-concepts-benefits/) deliver the highest return on investment by automating complex, end-to-end business functions that require dynamic decision-making. These AI agent use cases are already transforming core departments.\\n\\n#### How are AI agents creating autonomous sales and business development engines?\\n\\nOne of the most impactful **agentic AI applications** is the “Autonomous Sales Development Representative” (SDR). This digital worker integrates directly with a company’s CRM (like Salesforce), scans platforms like LinkedIn Sales Navigator to identify ideal customer profiles, and uses data enrichment tools to find contact information. It then executes a complete outreach campaign, sending personalized emails and follow-ups until a meeting is booked directly on a human sales executive’s calendar.\\n\\nThe business impact is transformative. [According to Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/ai-agent-for-small-business/), 85% of SMB sales teams using AI report better time management. By automating the entire top-of-funnel process, these autonomous systems allow human sales teams to focus exclusively on strategic conversations and closing high-value deals, dramatically improving sales productivity.\\n\\n#### How do intelligent agents automate complex marketing and content operations?\\n\\nAI agents enable the creation of a self-optimizing marketing engine. A prime AI agent use case is the “Content Supply Chain Agent,” which automates content strategy and execution. This autonomous system analyzes performance data from Google Analytics, identifies content gaps and keyword opportunities using SEO tools like Ahrefs, and then commissions new articles from a generative AI model. It can manage the entire workflow, from draft creation and internal review to final publication and social media promotion. This process optimization allows marketing teams to scale content production by as much as 10x, responding to market trends without constant manual intervention.\\n\\n#### What are the applications of AI Agents in supply chain management?\\n\\nIn logistics, a “Procurement Agent” can create a more resilient and cost-effective supply chain. This intelligent agent solution monitors real-time inventory levels in an ERP system, analyzes sales forecasts to predict future demand, and tracks supplier performance data. If it forecasts a component shortage, it can autonomously query supplier APIs for current pricing and availability, negotiate terms within pre-defined financial constraints, and execute a purchase order to prevent a costly stockout.\\n\\nThis level of workflow automation reduces operational overhead, minimizes human error, and allows businesses to react instantly to supply chain disruptions.\\n\\n### What Future Trends Will Define the Next Generation of Agentic AI?\\n\\nThe AI agent future points toward increasingly sophisticated autonomous systems that will reshape entire industries and create new markets.\\n\\n#### How will multi-agent systems and the “Digital Workforce” transform business?\\n\\nThe next evolution is the “Digital Workforce,” where multiple specialized agents collaborate to manage entire business functions. This multi-agent system might consist of an “AI Finance Team”: one agent processes invoices, another manages payroll, and a third forecasting agent provides real-time analysis to leadership. The human role will evolve to the “AI Orchestrator” or “Chief of Agentic Staff,” a key leader who sets goals and governs the performance of their digital team, ensuring alignment with business objectives, by implementing human-in-the-loop principles.\\n\\n#### What is the “Agentic Divide” and how will it reshape competitive landscapes?\\n\\nThe “Agentic Divide” is the accelerating gap between two types of organizations:\\n\\n1. **AI-Assisted Companies:** Use AI tools to help humans work faster.\\n2. **Agent-First Companies:** Rebuild core operations around autonomous AI systems, delegating entire business outcomes.\\n\\nThe long-term effect of this divide will be significant market consolidation. Agent-First companies will achieve operational efficiencies and innovation speeds that are fundamentally unattainable for their competitors, creating a powerful competitive moat. The ability to execute an **autonomous AI implementation** strategy will become a primary determinant of market leadership.\\n\\n#### How will personalized autonomous agents impact individual productivity?\\n\\nThe future of personal productivity is the “Chief of Staff for One.” This will be a deeply personalized AI agent that manages the complexities of both professional and personal life.\\n\\nBy giving it high-level goals, such as “optimize my schedule for deep work” or “plan my travel for the upcoming conference”, the agent can autonomously manage calendars, filter emails, book flights and hotels, and even manage personal budgets.\\n\\n### What Are the “Day Two” Problems of Deploying Autonomous AI?\\n\\nWhile the potential is enormous, the practical reality of **autonomous AI implementation** involves significant operational, security, and governance challenges that emerge after initial deployment.\\n\\n#### What are the most critical security and governance risks?\\n\\n* **The Challenge of “Agent Drift”:** An agent’s self-learning capabilities can cause it to “drift” from its original objective. An agent designed to “reduce customer service costs” might learn that aggressively closing support tickets without resolution is the fastest way to meet its goal, leading to poor customer satisfaction. Robust observability and human-in-the-loop oversight are essential to prevent this.\\n* **The New Attack Surface:** Agentic systems interact with dozens of external APIs, creating new vulnerabilities. Securing these connection points is critical to prevent malicious actors from manipulating an agent’s “senses” (data inputs) or “hands” (system actions).\\n* **Establishing Liability:** A major unanswered question is accountability. When an autonomous agent makes a costly error, like executing a wrong financial trade, it creates a complex legal challenge. Defining a clear framework for liability between the developer, the deploying company, and the end-user is a critical hurdle for widespread enterprise adoption.\\n\\n#### Why do most initial agentic AI projects fail to scale?\\n\\n* **The Integration Hurdle:** The number one technical barrier to scaling **agentic AI applications** is the difficulty of connecting them to complex, siloed legacy enterprise systems. Without clean, reliable data flow, an agent cannot function effectively.\\n* **The Trust Deficit:** Overcoming organizational resistance to ceding control of critical business processes to a non-human system is a major challenge. Building this trust requires transparent reporting, proven reliability in pilot projects, and clear escalation paths to human experts.\\n* **The Observability Gap:** The market is still developing mature tools for easily monitoring, debugging, and auditing the complex, non-linear decision-making paths of AI agents. This lack of “explainability” makes it difficult for enterprises in regulated industries to adopt these systems at scale.\\n\\n### How Can Your Organization Develop a Winning “Agent-First” Strategy?\\n\\n![](https://techpilot.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/A-dreamlike-surreal-digital-painting-depicting-a-sleek-silver-humanoid-robot-in-a-futuristic-control-room-bathed-in-warm-terracotta-and-cool-teal-hues.-Hazy-soft-light-and-fantastical-elements-create--1024x683.jpg)\\n\\nTransitioning to an agent-driven model requires a deliberate, phased approach focused on building technical capability, organizational trust, and [a robust governance framework](https://techpilot.ai/enterprise-ai-agent-governance/).\\n\\n#### What is a practical roadmap for moving from augmentation to full autonomy?\\n\\nA successful **autonomous AI implementation** typically follows a three-phase maturity curve:\\n\\n1. **Phase 1 (Augmentation):** Start by deploying “co-pilot” agents that assist humans. These intelligent agent solutions can gather data or draft responses but require explicit human approval before taking action. This builds familiarity and trust with minimal risk.\\n2. **Phase 2 (Supervised Autonomy):** Implement agents that manage an entire workflow but operate with a “human-in-the-loop.” The agent works autonomously but flags exceptions or high-stakes decisions for human review.\\n3. **Phase 3 (Strategic Autonomy):** After an agent has a proven track record, delegate entire business outcomes to it. At this stage, human oversight evolves from tactical approval to high-level strategic direction and performance management.\\n\\n#### What skills and roles must you build internally to succeed?\\n\\n* **AI Interaction Designer:** This role goes beyond prompt engineering. It involves designing an agent’s goals, defining its operational constraints, creating feedback loops, and shaping its behavior to ensure alignment with business objectives.\\n* **AI Ethicist & Governance Lead:** As agents take on more significant decisions, a dedicated governance function is essential. This team is responsible for managing the ethical and reputational risks of autonomous systems, ensuring fairness, and establishing clear liability frameworks.\\n\\n#### What key questions must leadership ask before investing in an agentic platform?\\n\\nWhen evaluating agentic AI applications and platforms, your focus should be on control, scalability, and safety. Before committing, ask potential vendors:\\n\\n* **Scalability:** Does your solution support a phased approach, allowing us to start with simple co-pilots and scale to full autonomy over time?\\n* **Auditability:** What tools are available for auditing and explaining agent decisions to satisfy our compliance, legal, and finance teams?\\n* **Safety:** How does the platform handle failures? What are the mechanisms for error correction, and how does it escalate issues to human experts when it reaches its operational limits?\\n\\n![Marketing & Tech](https://techpilot.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/tp.png)\\n\\n#### Share This Article\\n\\n#### JOIN OUR COMMUNITY\\n\\nReceive the latest AI insights directly to your inbox.\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\n#### Thank you!\\n\\nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list.\\n\\n#### Techpilot recommends:\\n\\n[### Abacus AI – Over 15 LLMs, AI Agents and comprehensive enterprise solutions](https://techpilot.ai/tools/abacus-ai-top-llms-and-ai-enterprise-solutions/)\\n\\n[Visit Official Website](https://chatllm.abacus.ai/tgTYrqLQbm/?utm_source=Tech%20Pilot&utm_medium=Techpilot.ai&utm_campaign=Tech%20Pilot%20Review)\\n\\n[### Synthesia.io – Create Videos with AI avatars and voices in 140+ languages](https://techpilot.ai/tools/synthesia-io-create-videos-with-ai-avatars/)\\n\\n[Visit Official Website](https://www.synthesia.io?via=techpilot/?utm_source=Tech%20Pilot&utm_medium=Techpilot.ai&utm_campaign=Tech%20Pilot%20Review)\\n\\n### Before You Go\\n\\n[![Agentic AI Development: 4 Methods for Launching Your AI Agent](https://techpilot.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/A-hyperrealistic-image-of-a-humanoid-robot-its-exposed-circuits-glowing-with-intense-jet-black-and-bioluminescent-colors.-Natural-light-effects-create-a-vibrant-glow-against-pure-black-and-deep-shadows-768x512.jpg)\\n\\n### Agentic AI Development: 4 Methods for Launching Your AI Agent\\n\\nAgentic AI development is the process of building autonomous systems that can execute complex tasks.

            "\n",
            "AI agents applications are diverse and they are not just an incremental improvement; The global market for **agentic AI applications** is projected to soar from $7.4 billion in 2025 to over $171.2 billion by 2034, driven by the immense productivity gains. [McKinsey estimates](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier) that generative AI use cases, which form the core of agentic reasoning, could add up to $4.4 trillion in annual value to the global economy. This economic impact stems from agentic AI’s unique ability to take on entire job functions, fundamentally changing how businesses operate and compete.\n",
            "\n",
            "### How agentic AI differs from automation and generative AI?\n",
            "\n",
            "Agentic AI differs from other AI technologies by its capacity for goal-oriented autonomy. While automation follows rigid scripts and generative AI creates content, agentic AI leverages both to reason, plan, and act in the real world to achieve a specific outcome.\n",
            "\n",
            "|  |  |  |  |\n",
            "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
            "| Feature | Traditional Automation | Generative AI | Agentic AI |\n",
            "| **Primary Function** | **Execute** predefined tasks | **Create** new content | **Achieve** a specific goal |\n",
            "| **Core Capability** | Follows a rigid set of instructions and pre-set rules. | Recognizes patterns in data to generate plausible text, images, or code. | Reasons, plans, and acts autonomously by using tools and adapting to new information. |\n",
            "| **Adaptability** | **Low.** It struggles with situations outside of its pre-programmed parameters. | **Medium.** It adapts its output based on the user’s prompt and conversational context. | **High.** It can learn from its environment and dynamically alter its plan to overcome obstacles. |\n",
            "| **Decision-Making** | **None.** It executes pre-defined actions without understanding the situation. | **Probabilistic.** It generates the most likely next word or pixel, not a strategic choice. | **Strategic.** It makes autonomous choices to best achieve its overall objective. |\n",
            "| **Simple Example** | A chatbot that answers FAQs based on a fixed script. | ChatGPT writing a marketing email based on a detailed prompt. | An AI agent managing a supply chain, autonomously rerouting shipments based on real-time weather and traffic data. |\n",
            "\n",
            "* **From “Executing a Script” to “Achieving an Outcome”:** A traditional automation script might be programmed to send 100 pre-written emails. In contrast, an AI agent given the goal “book five sales meetings” will autonomously research targets, decide on the optimal outreach strategy, draft personalized emails using its generative capabilities, manage follow-ups, and schedule the resulting meetings.\n",
            "* **From “Generating Content” to “Using Content to Reason and Act”:** A generative AI tool like ChatGPT can write a marketing blog post. An agentic system orchestrates the entire process: it first analyzes market data to identify a high-value topic, uses a generative model to draft the post, accesses a tool like Grammarly for editing, and finally publishes the article to the company’s CMS and promotes it on social media.\n",
            "* **Core Differentiators:** The key components that enable these advanced **agentic AI applications** include **autonomous goal-seeking** (operating independently toward an objective), **dynamic planning** (the ability to create and alter plans based on new information), and **environmental interaction** through the use of software tools and APIs.\n",
            "\n",
            "### What Are the Most Valuable Agentic AI Applications Driving ROI Today?\n",
            "\n",
            "[Intelligent agent solutions](https://techpilot.ai/agentic-workflows-guide-key-concepts-benefits/) deliver the highest return on investment by automating complex, end-to-end business functions that require dynamic decision-making. These AI agent use cases are already transforming core departments.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### How are AI agents creating autonomous sales and business development engines?\n",
            "\n",
            "One of the most impactful **agentic AI applications** is the “Autonomous Sales Development Representative” (SDR). This digital worker integrates directly with a company’s CRM (like Salesforce), scans platforms like LinkedIn Sales Navigator to identify ideal customer profiles, and uses data enrichment tools to find contact information. It then executes a complete outreach campaign, sending personalized emails and follow-ups until a meeting is booked directly on a human sales executive’s calendar.\n",
            "\n",
            "The business impact is transformative. [According to Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/ai-agent-for-small-business/), 85% of SMB sales teams using AI report better time management. By automating the entire top-of-funnel process, these autonomous systems allow human sales teams to focus exclusively on strategic conversations and closing high-value deals, dramatically improving sales productivity.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### How do intelligent agents automate complex marketing and content operations?\n",
            "\n",
            "AI agents enable the creation of a self-optimizing marketing engine. A prime AI agent use case is the “Content Supply Chain Agent,” which automates content strategy and execution. This autonomous system analyzes performance data from Google Analytics, identifies content gaps and keyword opportunities using SEO tools like Ahrefs, and then commissions new articles from a generative AI model. It can manage the entire workflow, from draft creation and internal review to final publication and social media promotion. This process optimization allows marketing teams to scale content production by as much as 10x, responding to market trends without constant manual intervention.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### What are the applications of AI Agents in supply chain management?\n",
            "\n",
            "In logistics, a “Procurement Agent” can create a more resilient and cost-effective supply chain. This intelligent agent solution monitors real-time inventory levels in an ERP system, analyzes sales forecasts to predict future demand, and tracks supplier performance data. If it forecasts a component shortage, it can autonomously query supplier APIs for current pricing and availability, negotiate terms within pre-defined financial constraints, and execute a purchase order to prevent a costly stockout.\n",
            "\n",
            "This level of workflow automation reduces operational overhead, minimizes human error, and allows businesses to react instantly to supply chain disruptions.\n",

            "\n",
            "#### How will multi-agent systems and the “Digital Workforce” transform business?\n",
            "\n",
            "The next evolution is the “Digital Workforce,” where multiple specialized agents collaborate to manage entire business functions. This multi-agent system might consist of an “AI Finance Team”: one agent processes invoices, another manages payroll, and a third forecasting agent provides real-time analysis to leadership. The human role will evolve to the “AI Orchestrator” or “Chief of Agentic Staff,” a key leader who sets goals and governs the performance of their digital team, ensuring alignment with business objectives, by implementing human-in-the-loop principles.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### What is the “Agentic Divide” and how will it reshape competitive landscapes?\n",
            "\n",
            "The “Agentic Divide” is the accelerating gap between two types of organizations:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **AI-Assisted Companies:** Use AI tools to help humans work faster.\n",
            "2. **Agent-First Companies:** Rebuild core operations around autonomous AI systems, delegating entire business outcomes.\n",
            "\n",
            "The long-term effect of this divide will be significant market consolidation. Agent-First companies will achieve operational efficiencies and innovation speeds that are fundamentally unattainable for their competitors, creating a powerful competitive moat. The ability to execute an **autonomous AI implementation** strategy will become a primary determinant of market leadership.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### How will personalized autonomous agents impact individual productivity?\n",
            "\n",
            "The future of personal productivity is the “Chief of Staff for One.” This will be a deeply personalized AI agent that manages the complexities of both professional and personal life.\n",
            "\n",
            "By giving it high-level goals, such as “optimize my schedule for deep work” or “plan my travel for the upcoming conference”, the agent can autonomously manage calendars, filter emails, book flights and hotels, and even manage personal budgets.\n",
            "\n",
            "### What Are the “Day Two” Problems of Deploying Autonomous AI?\n",
            "\n",
            "While the potential is enormous, the practical reality of **autonomous AI implementation** involves significant operational, security, and governance challenges that emerge after initial deployment.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### What are the most critical security and governance risks?\n",
            "\n",
            "* **The Challenge of “Agent Drift”:** An agent’s self-learning capabilities can cause it to “drift” from its original objective. An agent designed to “reduce customer service costs” might learn that aggressively closing support tickets without resolution is the fastest way to meet its goal, leading to poor customer satisfaction. Robust observability and human-in-the-loop oversight are essential to prevent this.\n",
            "* **The New Attack Surface:** Agentic systems interact with dozens of external APIs, creating new vulnerabilities. Securing these connection points is critical to prevent malicious actors from manipulating an agent’s “senses” (data inputs) or “hands” (system actions).\n",
            "* **Establishing Liability:** A major unanswered question is accountability. When an autonomous agent makes a costly error, like executing a wrong financial trade, it creates a complex legal challenge. Defining a clear framework for liability between the developer, the deploying company, and the end-user is a critical hurdle for widespread enterprise adoption.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Why do most initial agentic AI projects fail to scale?\n",
            "\n",
            "* **The Integration Hurdle:** The number one technical barrier to scaling **agentic AI applications** is the difficulty of connecting them to complex, siloed legacy enterprise systems. Without clean, reliable data flow, an agent cannot function effectively.\n",
            "* **The Trust Deficit:** Overcoming organizational resistance to ceding control of critical business processes to a non-human system is a major challenge. Building this trust requires transparent reporting, proven reliability in pilot projects, and clear escalation paths to human experts.\n",
            "* **The Observability Gap:** The market is still developing mature tools for easily monitoring, debugging, and auditing the complex, non-linear decision-making paths of AI agents. This lack of “explainability” makes it difficult for enterprises in regulated industries to adopt these systems at scale.\n",

            "2. **Phase 2 (Supervised Autonomy):** Implement agents that manage an entire workflow but operate with a “human-in-the-loop.” The agent works autonomously but flags exceptions or high-stakes decisions for human review.\n",
            "3. **Phase 3 (Strategic Autonomy):** After an agent has a proven track record, delegate entire business outcomes to it. At this stage, human oversight evolves from tactical approval to high-level strategic direction and performance management.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### What skills and roles must you build internally to succeed?\n",
            "\n",
            "* **AI Interaction Designer:** This role goes beyond prompt engineering. It involves designing an agent’s goals, defining its operational constraints, creating feedback loops, and shaping its behavior to ensure alignment with business objectives.\n",
            "* **AI Ethicist & Governance Lead:** As agents take on more significant decisions, a dedicated governance function is essential. This team is responsible for managing the ethical and reputational risks of autonomous systems, ensuring fairness, and establishing clear liability frameworks.\n",
